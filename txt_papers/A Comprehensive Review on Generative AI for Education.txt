efforts are being made to link everything with some ML
algorithm. In all these fields, GAI has become one of
the most popular and has outperformed all the existing
AI and ML technologies by proving its capabilities to all.
GAI is a set of AI algorithms that utilize existing content
like text, audio files, or images to create new content [1].
It allows computers to abstract the underlying pattern related
to the input and then use that to generate similar content.
Nowadays, GAI technologies available in the market are
specialized to do specific tasks, which have been categorized

intervention’s necessity to eliminate biases, ensuring the
model’s robustness and acceptance among diverse audiences.
Today’s world is globalized, where many ethnicities and
groups sit and work together. Having a biased GAI model
would reduce its acceptance among the students, and it can
also lead to a biased rationale of students from the very beginning of their lives, leading to a biased society. Hence, bias
must be removed from the GAI models.
The following measures could be taken to remove bias
from the model.
• To mitigate biases in GAI, selecting a diverse dataset is
essential. The model should undergo training and finetuning on this dataset to ensure it is not skewed toward
any particular group. This approach promotes fairness
and inclusivity in the generated outcomes.
• Regular monitoring and performance checks are imperative to detect and rectify biases in GAI models. These
ongoing evaluations ensure fairness and prevent the
reinforcement of any unintended biases in the generated
content.
• Adopting fairness measures and bias correction techniques, including pre-processing and post-processing
methods, is crucial. Tools such as AI Fairness 360, IBM
Watson OpenScale, and Google’s What-If Tool can be
utilized to identify and address biases effectively in GAI
models. These tools enhance the fairness and equity of
the generated content.
• Innovative transparency mechanisms should be developed to enable users to comprehend the model’s outputs
and the underlying data and assumptions used in
the generation process. This transparency fosters trust
and understanding, which is crucial for the ethical
deployment of GAI models.
• Training programs should be implemented for teachers
and students to recognize biases and learn appropriate
methods to address them effectively. This education promotes awareness and equips individuals with the skills
to handle discrimination in GAI applications.
• Continuous updates to the database with diverse and
unbiased datasets are essential. This ongoing effort
ensures that the GAI model remains current, representative, and free from biases, enhancing its outputs’ quality
and fairness.
H. LIMITED GENERALIZATION
GAI models frequently face difficulty generalizing beyond
their training data. While they can produce samples resembling the training data, creating diverse and entirely novel
outputs remains challenging. Generating content beyond the
confines of the training data poses a significant hurdle in this
technology.
I. COMPREHENSIBILITY AND EXPLAINIBILITY
GAI models are intricate and expansive, making them
difficult to interpret. Grasping and explaining specific outputs
generated by these models is a complex task. Consequently,
enhancing the explainability and interpretability of GAI
models has become a focal point for future research.
Numerous research groups are delving into these areas
to unravel the complexities associated with these models.
One of the chief ML technologies that could be used in
education is explainable AI (XAI). XAI means six principles:
interpretability, transparency, fairness, trust, robustness, and
privacy. Making the GAI models explainable helps the
researchers and the users track down where the model went
wrong, and it will also help train the users regarding how to
use the models. By doing so, the impact of such inaccuracies
on the student’s learning can be minimized, as a proper
guideline could also be devised, suggesting how to use the
GAI model and what should not be done. It will also help
create awareness among the students and the learners, helping
them to do their tasks effectively. XAI is being used in
industry for educational purposes. Some of the examples and
important case studies of it are
• FUMA a framework that is used for modeling and
supporting students in learning for various exploratory,
open-ended learning environments, such as interactive
simulations, educational games, etc.
• RiPPLE It is a course-level platform that instructors can
incorporate into their teaching.
• AcaWriter It has been developed to primarily target university-level writing through both integration into specific courses like law and accounting, wider rollout to all
students and supporting academic material to implement
the tool in their context, and a high-level research version
both as a standalone and integrated into an online course
for learning how to write the abstract.
• TeamWork Analytics It was developed to support
educators and undergraduate nursing students enrolled
in clinical units.
J. COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES
GAI models demand substantial computational power, relying on advanced hardware and extensive training data. Their
development and deployment consume significant time and
resources, limiting their accessibility. This means devising
such models requires a lot of funds and expertise. Due to this,
GAI models could not be built or used at small scales, making
it difficult for schools and small educational institutions to
afford these models and use them regularly in classes.
Reuters reported that OpenAI, since 2020, has utilized a
massive supercomputer constructed by Microsoft, equipped
with 10,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) [146].
Among these, ChatGPT uses the NVIDIA A100 HPC
accelerator, a high-performance tensor core GPU costing
$12,500, featuring 80 GB of HBM2 memory with up
to 2 TBps memory bandwidth [147]. An analysis by Bernstein
analyst Stacy Rasgon indicates that each ChatGPT query
costs approximately 4 cents. If ChatGPT queries reached a
tenth of Google’s search volume, it would require around
$48.1 billion worth of GPUs and about $16 billion worth of
chips annually to remain operational.

K. DATA REQUIREMENTS
GAI models need high-quality training data to grasp meaningful patterns and produce realistic content. Acquiring and
organizing extensive and diverse datasets can be exceptionally challenging, especially in fields where data availability
is limited [148].
L. DISTINGUISH MODEL VS. STUDENT RESPONSES
With advancements in GAI, distinguishing between humanwritten and machine-generated text has become increasingly
challenging. Addressing this concern, New York City’s
Department of Education banned ChatGPT from school
devices and networks [149]. A tool named GPTZero has
been developed to detect AI-generated text. It utilizes
perplexity as a measure, indicating generalization capabilities
and seeing AI involvement in text creation. Techniques
such as watermarking, proposed by [150], involve inserting
specific words uncommon in human conversation, aiding in
distinguishing AI-generated content.
M. TRIGGER EMOTIONS THROUGH GAI
In a recent study outlined by [39], specific prompts were
utilized to evoke curiosity among students, showcasing the
potential of enhancing learning experiences. However, this
innovation also raises significant concerns. If this technology
were compromised, malicious individuals could exploit it
to manipulate students’ emotions negatively. Such misuse
can potentially cause misinformation and harm, underlining
the critical need for ethical considerations in implementing
emotion-inducing AI in educational settings.
Children and students inherently require emotional support. If malicious entities manipulate emotions, it can
profoundly impact students, diverting them down destructive
paths. Hence, when it comes to students, it is crucial
to scrutinize and regulate AI’s emotion-inducing features,
finding ways to prevent such potential harm [151]
N. VERITY OF CONTENT
The verity of the content produced by GAI is a crucial
concern. Although GAI can produce huge amounts of
educational content, their accuracy and reliability are not
always guaranteed. For example, the content generated by
GAI may not always reflect the nuances and complexities
of the real world, which may lead to false conclusions and
interpretations. The quality of content generated may also
vary, along with the existing concerns of content ownership,
privacy, and security.
Some of the potential measures to solve the problem are
• GAI tools should be integrated with human oversight
and validation, ensuring the quality and credibility of the
generated educational content.
• Strong frameworks should be established to safeguard
the stakeholders and ensure the responsibility of GAI in
education.
• Quality assurance machines should be developed which
will help assure the integrity and the value of the educational content generated by GAI.
• Educators should be properly trained regarding how to
use the content generated by GAI in their educational
content.
• Awareness should be created among the educators and
the students regarding the limitations of GAI in this field,
to help them not to fall prey to this limitation of GAI.
O. FEEDBACK MECHANISM IN GENERATIVE AI
As discussed above, it can be easily concluded that GAI poses
many problems that hinder GAI’s wide-scale acceptance in
educational institutions. One of the ways to help GAI be more
robust is through the use of feedback mechanisms or feedback
loops. Feedback loops help the model learn from the outputs
it has previously generated and the mistakes committed previously. Feedback loops identify the mistakes in the outputs
generated by the model and then help the model prevent it
from committing similar mistakes in the future. The corrected
information is then fed into the model as input, which allows
it to retrain and adapt to new data. This process continuously
helps to improve the accuracy and performance of the model.
Human feedback is also valuable in this loop. It is precious in
model drifts when the model’s accuracy degrades over time
due to changes in the user’s behavior, various updates in the
content, and seasonal trends. Human evaluators can evaluate
model predictions and provide valuable feedback, which will
help rectify the discrepancies in the model.
Feedback loops help the model to learn from its mistakes
and increase the reliability and accuracy of the outputs.
By continuously improving the model’s performance, the
feedback loops reduce the need for the intervention of a
human being, thus making the model more efficient and
cost-effective. It also increases the model’s adaptability by
adapting to the ever-changing behavior of human beings. This
is also important because children’s behavior changes very
rapidly.
If the feedback provided to the model is malicious, then
it will significantly affect the accuracy and performance of
the model, irrespective of whether the malicious feedback
was intentional or unintentional. Malicious feedback can
lead to bias in the model, which results in inaccurate and
unfair predictions, leading to significant consequences in the
educational sector, as discussed earlier in X-G. Malicious
feedback can also erode trust in the model, as many users may
become skeptical of its predictions. This can lead to losing
confidence in the model, ultimately harming its adoption and
usage.
Some ways to mitigate malicious feedback are implementing a detection mechanism to identify malicious feedback through some ML algorithm or manual detection or
techniques like data validation, filtering, anomaly detection,
etc. If some malicious feedback is detected, it should be
immediately flagged for further review, and legal action could
also be taken. Machine Unlearning algorithms could also

remove that malicious feedback from the model without
disturbing any of the crucial model’s information [152].
XI. FUTURE RESEARCH WORKS

particularly in applications like autonomous vehicles.
Moreover, progress can be made by ensuring models
generate content within defined user constraints. Integrating
multiple modalities, including images, audio, and videos, into
generative models broadens the scope of GAI, enhancing its
versatility and accessibility.
Additionally, valuable research directions include investigating techniques for few-shot learning (making predictions
based on limited samples) and zero-shot understanding (generalizing from a category of pieces using pre-trained models)
in GAI. Training models to generate content with minimal
examples enhances flexibility and adaptability, making GAI
more responsive to diverse contexts and requirements.
C. BIAS AND FAIRNESS
Addressing issues related to bias and fairness is critical in
GAI. Future research should focus on detecting biases in
training data and developing unbiased models representing
diverse populations. It is essential to ensure impartial outputs
across demographic groups. Exploring methods to enhance
the interpretability of these models is crucial. Models should
be capable of explaining their generated content, increasing
user acceptance, and aiding in identifying and correcting
potential shortcomings. Improving the interpretability of GAI
models is vital for their adoption, particularly in critical
domains. Further research can concentrate on developing
techniques to interpret the decision-making processes of
these models.
D. ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE AI
In the realm of GAI, it is essential for research to prioritize
ethical considerations and responsible usage. This means

essential to guarantee that these models generate accurate and
reliable outputs, even in the presence of malicious inputs.
To achieve this, GAI models must be fortified against
various attacks, including data leakage and model inversion
attacks. Strengthening the security measures surrounding
these models is essential to maintain their effectiveness and
trustworthiness, safeguarding them from potential vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment in real-world
applications.
F. HUMAN AI COLLABORATION

advancement of AI technology and its positive impact on
environmental research and sustainability efforts.
H. EXPLORE NEW ARCHITECTURE AND PARADIGMS
Combining neural networks with symbolic logic offers a
promising avenue to create generative models capable of reasoning and generating structured, interpretable outputs [153].
This integration can instill logic and reasoning skills in
students, enhancing their understanding and problem-solving
abilities [154].
Additionally, the potential of quantum computing in
generative modeling should be thoroughly explored [155].
Investigating the advantages of quantum parallelism can
open new doors for generating intricate data distributions,
offering innovative solutions to complex computational
challenges [156]. By harnessing the power of quantum computing, generative models can potentially achieve significant
advancements in their capabilities and efficiency [157].
