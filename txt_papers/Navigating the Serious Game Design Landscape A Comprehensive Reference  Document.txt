 Abstract  
Within the evolving field of digital intervention, serious games emerge as 
promising tools for evidence -based interventions. Research indicates that 
gamified therapy, whether employed independently or in conjunction with 
online psychoeducation or tradition al programs, proves more efficacious 
in delivering care to patients. As we navigate the intricate realm of serious 
game design, bridging the gap between therapeutic approaches and creative 
design proves complex. Professionals in clinical and research roles  
demonstrate innovative thinking yet face challenges in executing engaging 
therapeutic serious games due to the lack of specialized design skills and 
knowledge. Thus, a larger question remains : How might we aid and 
educate professionals in clinical and research roles the importance of game 
design to support their innovative therapeutic approaches? This study 
examines potential solutions aimed at facilitating the integration of 
gamification  design principles into clinical study protocols – a pivotal 
aspect fo r aligning therapeutic practices with captivating narratives in the 
pursu it of innovative interventions. We propose two solutions, a flow chart 
framework for serious games or a comprehensive reference document 
encompassing gamification design  principles and guidelines for best 
design practices. Through an examination of literature reviews, it was 
observed that selected design decisions varied across studies. Thus, we 
propose that the second solution, a comprehensive reference design guide, 
is more versatile  and adaptable. 
 
1. Introduction  
Serious game is a term that has been used to describe video games that are designed specifically 
for training and education al purposes  [1]. These serious games incorporate gamification 
techniques by integrating game -like elements into their inventions [18] [34].  The therapeutic 
use of commercially available video games in various patient populations has been documented 
in literature since the early 1980s, as reported by [4] and [5].  It wasn’t until Ben Sawyer 
popularized serious games in 2002 when he launched “Seri ous Games Initiative”, a foundation 
that attracted game designers, educators, and academics alike [2]. T he healthcare industry  has 
become increasingly interested in using games as an effective tool for mental health 
interventions, skill development, and improving patient care  [3] [15] [18] .  
Despite their interests and the significant advancements of serious games, a substantial gap 
between existing therapeutic treatments and actionable design practices remains. To our 
knowledge, there are minimal literature reviews that provide a general guide on which 
gamification techniques or design practices yield best results in serious game design. Current 
 
2 literature reviews suggest design frameworks and principles, often tailored to specific sectors 
or clinical issues  (e.g., educational sector, autism, anxiety, pain management). The existing 
resources tend to be specialized, lacking a broad overview that would benefit those new to the 
field or seeking a holistic understanding of serious game design. Thus, there is a gap in 
addressing novice professionals seeking a high -level overview of the serious game design 
landscape. Another challenge is the lack of unde rstanding between game designers, developers, 
and professionals in clinical and research roles. Limited comprehension of team members’ roles 
and industry vertical, in relation to their own expertise, results in suboptimal collaboration and 
design of seriou s games [6] [18]. Consider a scenario where a developer, previously specialized 
in finance applications, is assigned the role of developing a serious game for paediatric patients 
with anxiety. In this scenario, the developer may lack awareness of design ch oices that could 
inadvertently lead to more harm than good. Similarly, professionals in clinical and research 
roles may find that ideating a serious game is not the most advisable course of action when 
addressing best practices or efficacy. In other words,  serious games have marked a significant 
milestone in defining what we believe to be the upcoming era of therapeutic technologies, but 
more bridge building and understanding between supporting members is necessary before 
implementing design strategies on h ealth.  
To aid in this collaboration and help experts from respective professions, we conducted a 
comprehensive examination of literature reviews on serious games and the broader game design 
landscape.  Our objective was to address the question: How can we effectively communicate to 
professionals the significance of game design in supporting innovative therapeutic approaches 
of serious games?  
2. Methods and Material  
2.1 Gam ification  Design Principles Affinity Mapping  
Ten gamification  design principles from credible literature reviews were revealed  following 
the principles of affinity mapping developed by Jiro Kawakita [7]. The affinity map technique 
is a structured data visualization exercise used to organize complex qualitative data to 
understand common themes, identify patterns, and support the m eta-analysis interpretation of 
multiple studies [8] –[10]. Keywords regarding gam ification  design principles were used as the 
search terms, resulting in 1,869  results from the Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) 
library database [11]–[18] [34 ]–[43]. Consideration was also given to landscapes of  award -
wining game studios and their published articles  about game design principles [19] –[22]. Thus, 
twenty -two sources were examined to determine final gam ification  design principles : 
1. Clear Goals and Objectives  
2. Design Around Core Mechanics  
3. Maintain Game Flow and Player Experience  
4. Balancing the Game  
5. Storytelling and Immersion  
6. Reward and Points System  
7. Regular Feedback and Reflection  
8. Visual and Auditory Elements  
9. Social Affordances  
10. Playtesting  
2.2 Literature Review and Comparisons of Serious Games  
Following the refinement of gamification design principles built on the affinity mapping 
technique, we investigated literature reviews of serious games. Keywords regarding serious 
Julieana Moon  et al.

 games were used in conjunction with feasibility study, designing and assessing, the effect of, 
design features of, and therapeutic interventions of . In this section, twelve published literature 
review of serious games were selected by flexible criteria’s:  
1. Address any one specific health -related disease or condition  
2. Design and develop a  serious game or simulation  
3. Provide empirical evidence or analysis illustrating the game’s efficacy  
 
This exploration focused on comprehending published literature on serious games and 
evaluating the alignment with our own gamification design principles. Simultaneously, we 
aimed to investigate if specific clinical protocols were employed in guiding and st andardizing 
the serious game in addressing a particular clinical issue. The exploration further focused on 
determining whether this had any impact on the application of gamification design principles 
as presented in Table 1.

2.3 Literature Review of Game Design and Gamification Techniques  
Transitioning into the examination of game design and gamification techniques, this section 
aims to uncover insights and trends that inform our understanding of effective design practices 
when developing serious games.  
Literature reviews suggest different approaches when it comes to design decisions. For 
instance, A. Schwarz et al.’s work [33] investigates design features associated with engagement 
in mobile health (mHealth) physical activity (PA) interventions among chi ldren, where C. 
Tziraki et al.’s work [12] investigates design features in patients with dementia (PwD) over 65 
years old. A. Shwarz et al.’s study determined that children had positive associations with 
engagement for features like a clear interface, rewa rds, multiplayer game mode, social 
interaction, self -monitoring, and a variety of customization options, including self -set goals, 
feedback, and progress [33]. Where other features such as sounds, competition, instructions, 
notifications, virtual maps, or self-monitoring were negatively associated with engagement, 
emphasizing the need for careful consideration [33]. C. Tziraki et al.’s study, focused on PwD, 
identified key themes from its serious game pilot study. Firstly, PwD showed a preference for 
tablet s over laptops due to ease of manipulation; they can hold and adjust the device with 
minimal difficulties [12]. Secondly, auditory cues and instructions were found to enhance 
performance for PwD, with the delivery modality of instructions being considered crucial 
considering attention span limitations, potential sensory degradation, and language nuances 
[12]. As a result, instructions were presented in both written and vocal formats for each game 
screen [12]. Comparing the two studies, while children in the  first study exhibited negative 
associations with sounds and instructions, geriatric patients using tablets in the second study 
Julieana Moon  et al.   
 
 5 
 preferred these features. Significant variations exist in cognitive and emotional development, 
leading to distinct preferences in the types of games that attract young children compared to 
those favored by geriatric individuals [11]. The discrepancy in des ign preferences emphasizes 
the importance of considering age groups, study designs, and content variations when 
determining design features [33].  
An additional study conducted by [34] offers a comprehensive exploration of game 
motivators and game principles related to educational serious games. Within this study, 54 
educational game design principles in 13 classes and 56 game motivators in 14 classe s were 
presented [34]. This nuanced study builds upon an extensive foundation laid by previous 
literature reviews on gamification techniques within the educational domain [34].  
K Kolln [46] explores a flowchart crafted to facilitate the selection of optimal gamification 
techniques tailored to a specific use case. A readily accessible process tool that is user -friendly, 
informative, and suitable for individuals with limited expert ise or experience in the field. In 
her paper “Maybe We Don’t Need a New Gamification Framework After All”, she elaborates 
on the idea of an automated process for any use case. Although in the research phase, the aim 
is to develop a process for finding the most suitable gamification framework (GF) based on 
factors such as project type, context, budget, or developer skills [46]. It serves as a valuable 
resource for crafting gamification strategies within a contextually appropriate framework yet 
comes with som e negative connotations. For one, creating a fixed framework may prove 
challenging and would need extensive research and literature review to support the concrete 
pathway of a successful serious game. Second, the selection criteria when matching identified  
frameworks need to be clearly defined when calculating the best solution [46]. Lastly, as 
improved gamification frameworks continue to emerge, the adaptability and restructuring of 
the flowchart requires continual refinement to remain current and effectiv e. These factors 
require meticulous effort and can cause the flowcharts to be unusable.  
3. Proposed Guidelines and Best Practices  
3.1 Introduction to Proposed Guidelines and Best Practices  
Developers and researchers who seek to create serious games need to consider that design 
decisions are not universally suitable for all users. A solution that remains flexible, allows for 
efficient collaboration, and workflow optimization is a comprehensiv e reference document of 
gamification design principles and guidelines for best design practices. We consider this 
solution an optimal choice for effectively conveying the importance of game design because of 
its adaptability and versatility. The assumption  of gamification techniques tied to a specific use 
case is avoided, affording professionals the freedom to utilize the practical tool as a foundation 
resource rather than a structural framework.  
This document serves as a centralized resource for serious game creation, offering guidance 
with established design principles and best practices. It streamlines decision -making during the 
design phase, ensuring a cohesive and standardized approach to seri ous game development. 
Derived from literature reviews, research, and practical experience, this reference document 
stands as an authoritative tool for crafting impactful and engaging serious game s.  
3.2 Gamification Design Principles  
Gamification techniques and game design principles are distinct yet interconnected concepts 
in the realm of game development. Game design principles encompass the fundamental 
guidelines and elements employed in crafting games, influencing aspects like mech anics, 
dynamics, and aesthetics. These principles serve as the foundational framework for creating 
engaging and well -structured gaming experiences [19] –[21]. On the other hand, gamification 
 
6 techniques refer to the strategic incorporation of game -like elements, such as points, badges, 
rewards, and challenges, into non -game contexts to enhance user engagement and participation 
[34] [38] [44]. While game design principles focus on the holistic d esign of games, 
gamification techniques are specifically applied to non -game scenarios to leverage the 
motivational and interactive qualities commonly found in games [44]. In essence, game design 
principles guide the overall construction of games, while ga mification techniques extend these 
principles into various non -game environments, leveraging game -like elements to drive user 
engagement and achieve specific objectives [38].  
Twenty -two literature  reviews were evaluated to decide on final  gamification  design 
principles [11 ]–[22] [34 ]–[43]. The primary focus of these design principles is not directed 
towards the assessment of the effectiveness, validity, functionality, or success of a serious 
game. Instead, it centers on providing an overall structure of gamification design principles to 
explain the learning benefits of and inform the design of serious games.  
3.2.1  Clear Goals and Objectives  
The objective of the game should be clear and concise [22] [34]. It provides a focused direction 
for the user, enabling coherent and purposeful execution [14] [19] [40] [43]. The serious game 
may encompass either a primary goal or several small goals. A pr imary goal is the completion 
of the entire game, while the small goals serve to motivate the player to progress and achieve 
the primary goal [19].  Furthermore, the game goal content should be meaningful to the player 
[20] and should convince the player th at there is a deeper meaning in playing beyond 
entertainment [34]. Goals should be achievable, so the player has a sense of accomplishment.  
3.2.2  Design Around Core Mechanics  
The game should have few core mechanics for the player to immediately understand how to 
play the game. Nearly every game, whether classified as a serious game or not, revolves around 
one or few gameplay mechanics [19] [36]. Take Tetris for example, where t he core mechanic 
involves rotating shapes to fit together. Another example is the serious game Re -Mission, their 
core mechanic is to shoot cancer cells and combat side effects [32]. Defining the core action 
that players will consistently engage in is cruci al to keep players involved [11] [20].  Game 
controls should be simple to use to lower the learning curve of a game and allow the player to 
focus on the game’s content [19] [21] [34]. One way to achieve this is to use controls that are 
familiar to the target audience, such as a spacebar for jump ing or limiting interaction to one or 
two buttons.  
Game controls should also immediately yield results after input (e.g., the arm of an avatar 
should mirror the player’s arm) [34]. Laggy feedback on input controls may cause lower 
usability and player disengagement [34]. Another way to design around core me chanics is to 
use grounded clinical protocols, utilizing real scientific data, to decide on the learning content 
and  activities of the game (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy programs) [37].  
3.2.3  Maintain Game Flow and Player Experience  
The serious game should maintain the flow of the game and increase player experience. One 
way to do this is to allow for profile and ownership. Expressive choices refer to decisions made 
by the player that have minimal impact on learning but can significantly enhance player 
motivation [42]. These choices might include allowing the player to freely choose an avatar  or 
name their avatar. Granting players control over these aspects can foster the development of 
empathy and a sense of ownership [42]. Furthermor e, offering access to gameplay data (skills 
learned, goals met, badges awarded, status) through the player's profile is another effective 
method for promoting ownership and facilitating gameplay adaptation [16] [34].   
To maintain game flow, the game’s user interface should be simple and intuitive to use. This 
reduces the cognitive load of the player and is particularly important when target users have 
Julieana Moon  et al.   
 
 7 
 impaired cognitive abilities [19] [34]. Another way is to make links to the game’s activity and 
the real world, this increases the players relevance and relatedness to the game [13] [34].   
3.2.4  Balancing the Game  
A game is considered balanced when it presents players with an equal opportunity to succeed 
[21], a serious game that is easy to learn but difficult to master [20] [22]. It should present 
challenges aligned with the player’s abilities, while avoiding overl y complex tasks [19] –[21] 
[34] [39]. Achieving a balanced game is crucial, as an overly difficult game may demotivate 
players, while an excessively easy one risks losing the players interest [15] [17] [19] [21] [39]. 
The progression of levels should begin with instructive tutorials and beginner -friendly 
challenges, gradually advancing towards more difficult levels [22]  [36] [42] . The adjustment 
of difficulty levels can occur through manual selection (players select their own difficulty 
level), a preprogrammed system (the difficulty gradually increases as the players progress), or 
a dynamic approach (players action determine approp riate difficulty level) [34]. Providing 
adequate time to solve the challenges is also important for enhancing the player’s learnab ility 
and fostering moments of reflection [34].  
3.2.5  Storytelling and Immersion  
Storytelling is a significant tool for social interaction and information sharing, it enhances 
player involvement and makes playing more memorable [11] [16] [17] [21] [26] [34] [36]. 
Narrative transportation, characterized by deep engagement in a story, in volves a sense of 
detachment from reality and a journey into the imaginative realm of the narrative [38]. 
According to transportation theory, this experience can impact real -world beliefs and actions 
through three key components: mental imagery, emotional responses, and a diminished 
connection to real -world information [36] [38]. Stories take place at a specific timeframe, 
location, and involve characters with external or internal conflicts [11] [39]. To ensure the 
stories appropriateness, the game’s target  audience should be clear (e.g., older adult target 
audiences may not be intrigued by a story about superheroes) [34].  
For further immersion, allowing the player to assume the role of a character in the story 
enhances immersion and expression [17] [42] [43]. The roles can be assigned (the game 
automatically assigns the role), selected (the player selects a role among pre -created roles), or 
created (the player creates a role from scratch) [34]. This supports the customization and 
control motivators [13] [34].  
3.2.6  Reward and Points System  
Rewarding and acknowledging a player’s gameplay serves as a motivational factor, 
encouraging them to engage in the game further [11] [16] [19] [20] –[22] [36]. Psychological 
studies have shown that rewards serve as a more effective tool for reinforcement than 
punishment [17]. If a player needs encouragement to perform an action, it is better to use a 
reward than a punishment (e.g., rewarding a player with power ups after losing all their lives) 
[17]. Rewards can be in the form of points, achievements, or badges. Points are typically 
displayed on leaderboards or used to calculate b adges/achievements [35].  
It's important to note that reward -based gamification presents certain challenges. When 
aiming for long -term change in serious games, research indicates that relying on rewards can 
be counterproductive  [38] [39] . While this approach is highly effective in achieving short -term 
change  (generat es immediate s pike in engagement ), the discontinuation of rewards can result 
in the behaviour discontinuing with it [39]. Moreover, reward -based gamification tends to 
overlook intrinsic motivation, and its excessive use may lead to spill -over effects  (a player 
expects a reward for every task ) [38]–[40]. Designers must be mindful that  players in such 
reward cycles anticipate increasing rewards with improved performance, creating a potentiall y 
never -ending cycle [39]. If a serious game incorporates extrinsic motivators such as rewards, 
 
8 their purpose should be primarily to offer feedback on player performance, thereby fostering 
sustained engagement [40].  These rewards should then be replaced with more meaningful 
intrinsic motivators, such as narrative storytelling, the autonomy to choose paths, engaging 
activities, and opportunities for reflection [39].  
3.2.7  Regular Feedback and Reflection  
Players experience a sense of competence when provided with distinct feedback for their 
actions. The feedback should be clear and positive, fostering constructive and educational 
remarks aimed at improvement [20] [34] [37] [42] . Feedback can be presented through text, 
visual cues, or auditory cues (e.g., sound effect when a player completes a task) [19] [21] [42].  
The concept of reflection involves providing players with opportunities to think about their 
game -based experiences, a powerful tool in helping a game have meaning well after the game 
is over [39]. T his reflective process allows players to analyze their actions and consider how 
these choices relate to their own lives. The presentation of reflections can take various forms, 
ranging from a timeline snapshot of the player's activities to a game character  prompting the 
player to recount their experiences  [39] [ 41]. Alternatively, breaking the fourth wall and having 
a representative directly engage with the player is another effective method of facilitating this 
reflective practice  [39] [41] . 
3.2.8  Visual and Auditory Elements  
Visual and auditory elements in serious games are used to enhance immersive gameplay 
experience [16] [17] [19] [34] [36] [42]. Visual elements, such as vibrant graphics, intuitive 
interfaces, and compelling animations, not only make the game aesthetically pleasing but also 
aid in conveying information, guiding players, and creating an immersive environment  [11] 
[19]. For instance, incorporating visual cues like progress bars, icons, or way -finding arrows 
can provide players with a clear understanding of the ir progress or upcoming challenges  [36]. 
On the other hand, auditory elements, including background music, sound effects, and 
voiceovers, contribute to the emotional engagement of players and add depth to the gaming 
experience  [19]. Well -designed audio can create a more immersive atmosphere, evoke specific 
emotions, and enhance the overall storytelling within the serious game (e.g., sound cues to 
reinforce positive actions or accomplishments)  [42].  
It is also worth mentioning that combining visual and auditory cues can significantly benefit 
players with cognitive deficiencies, facilitating a better understanding of the game. For 
instance,  individuals with dementia often experience degraded information processing across 
cognitive, visual, and auditory senses, resulting in reduced cognitive performance [12]. To 
address these challenges, exploring the integration of multisensory elements is re commended, 
as it can effectively assist in mitigating physiolo gical changes associated with cognitive 
deficiencies [12]  [16] [37] . 
3.2.9  Social Affordances  
Hamari et al.  classifies guilds, teams, social network, social status, opponents, and direct 
communication as social affordances serving as channels for interaction and expression [35]. 
To contribute to a dynamic and engaging social atmosphere, consider incorporating features 
such as in -game chats, discussion boards, leaderboards, and multiplayer activities [14] [16] 
[34] [38] [39] . Allowing players to express their status and achievements can significantly 
influence their in -game actions, acting as powerful motivators for sustained engagement. 
Furthermore, these social affordances present valuable opportunities for collaboration, 
enabling players to form groups or engage in activities with friends, fostering  a sense of 
teamwork and shared accomplishments [34]  [37] [39] . 
Creating opportunities for social affordances requires careful consideration of the optimal 
timing to introduce other players. A player should feel confident within a game environment 
Julieana Moon  et al.   
 
 9 
 and its game mechanics before introducing additional players, as premature engagement may 
make them feel uncomfortable [39]. Forcing a player into a social engagement too quickly can 
demotivate the player to continue to pla y [39].  
3.2.10  Playtesting  
Playtesting the serious game with both users and experts can elicit design feedback that reveals 
the effectiveness of the serious game and the gamification techniques used [13] [19]. 
Emphasizing design decisions and assessing their impact through a compara tive user study can 
also provide invaluable insights into the efficacy of different approaches, guiding the 
refinement of future iterations [21] [26].  
3.3 Guidelines for Best Design Practices  
Three  significant  literature reviews  were examined, each providing extensive insights into best 
design practices.  The initial study explores a framework that incorporates therapeutic content 
into serious games, serving as a valuable resource for novice serious game developers . The 
second paper highlights the importance of addressing psychological needs when designing 
technology , emphasizing the human -centric approach . Lastly, the third paper investigates a 
post-serious game development framework, focusing o n ensuring rationale, functionality, 
validity, and data safety —an essential guide for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of 
serious games beyond their initial creation.  
While these studies offer valuable frameworks and considerations, the nature of design is 
inherently dynamic. Professionals are strongly encouraged to adapt and tailor the insights 
provided by these literature reviews to meet the unique requirements of ser ious game design. 
These reviews should be considered as foundational resources, offering valuable perspectives 
that can be thoughtfully integrated into the design process.  
3.3.1  Framework for Integrating Therapeutic Content into Serious Games  
P. Siriaraya et al.  [15] introduces a framework to integrate game design into therapeutic 
content. It proposes a design process framework based on the concept of "game world" versus 
"therapy world" experiences. It identifies four components of a "therapy world" that can be 
gamifie d into a "game world" experience to increase user engagement: performance space, 
rules, content, and structure (see Fig. 1) .  
 
Figure 1.  Three examples of strategies to integrate game worlds from existing therapeutic activities: (A) 
Creating a reward system based on the results. (B) Restructuring the rules and performance space. (C) 
Restructuring the content and structure.  

 
10 To facilitate the design of gamified therapeutic interventions, the authors propose a Dual -
Loop Design model. This model emphasizes the similarities between the core interaction 
processes in therapeutic activities and game design's core -game loop. The model suggests that 
a core -game loop can be designed around the therapeutic activity loop, thereby enhancing the 
user experience of therapy components  (See Fig. 2) . 
 
Figure 2.  Effect of the core -game loop on the therapy game world.  
This framework is one of the first papers to combine interdisciplinary health/game research 
to help designers integrate game design elements with therapeutic content in mind. A key 
challenge in this integration is balancing the therapeutic and game design components, ensuring 
that adding gamification techniq ues enhances engagement without undermining the therapeutic 
value. The paper argues that merely adding game elements without considering the target 
audience risks alienating players or undermining the effectiveness of the therapeutic structures. 
This metho d was specifically developed to support the design process of serious games, 
with the key processes used in a therapeutic activity forming the foundation of the concepts 
and models proposed in a serious game.  
3.3.2  Motivation Engagement and Thriving in User Experience (METUX)  
This paper presents a comprehensive model, Motivation Engagement and Thriving in User 
Experience (METUX), which integrates psychological research into human -computer 
interaction (HCI) design  [45]. The model emphasizes the importance of satisfying basic 
psychological needs to foster motivation, engagement, and user wellbeing. These three basic 
needs are autonomy (feeling agency and alignment with goals and values), competence (feeling 
able and effective), and relatedness (feeling connected to others, a sens e of belonging) [ 45]. 
The paper highlights that user engagement in technology is heavily influenced by how 
technology design aligns with these psychological needs. In other words, if you increase 
autonomy then engagement will improve, if you increase competence then motivati on will 
increase, and if you increase relatedness then wellbeing will be enhanced [ 45].  
METUX identifies six spheres of influence where technology can impact wellbeing: 
adoption, interface, task, behavior, life, and society [ 45]. The model suggests that for 
technology to be beneficial, it should support psychological needs across these six spheres. For 
instance, in the adoption phase, user motivation to adopt technology should be autonomous and 
aligned with their values. In the interface sphere, direct interaction with technology should 
satisfy psychological needs, enhancing usability and enga gement. The task sphere focuses on 
the fulfillment of psychological needs through specific technology -enabled tasks. The behavior 
sphere extends to the broader behaviors that technology aims to support or enhance, like 
exercise or meditation. The life sphe re considers the overall impact of technology on an

 individual's life, including its potential to improve or harm overall wellbeing. Finally, the 
society sphere looks at the broader societal impacts of technology, such as economic and 
environmental effects  (See Fig. 3) .

3.3.3  Systematically Assess Serious Games  
M. Graafland et al.  [18] introduces a consensus -based framework for assessing medical serious 
games, providing sixty -two items across five main themes: rationale, functionality, validity, 
and data safety. It was developed by the Dutch Society for Simulation in Healthcare (DSSH) 
and based on the reporting standards for non -game mobile health apps (mHealth)  [18]. The 
framework was developed to address the unique aspects of serious games and how they differ 
from standard mHealth apps in terms of content and interaction goals.  Overall, th is framework  
provides a structured approach for evaluating serious games in healthcare, supporting all 
profess ionals involved in assessing the relevance, validity, and safety of the game.  It helps 
inform decisions when applying a serious game for healthcare purposes.  
4. Conclusions  
We began this work operating under the assumption that professionals in clinician and research 
roles have not thoroughly investigated the gamification design landscape and best design 
practices. The effectiveness of serious games to change health behaviors and improve patient 
care suggests that the building blocks of serious games should be considered when designing 
interventions in healthcare [32].  
This literature review revealed that there is much more to be explored from gamification 
techniques in serious games  and has the potential to be combined with earlier research to create 
new research paths. The intent of this research was not to offer a definitive list of gamification 
techniques or to advocate implementing these into serious games. Instead, this investigation 
was constrained to examining how different gamification techniques from literature revi ews 
might help inform professionals about the c reation of serious games. Rather than picking and 
choosing gamification techniques out of a bag, we suggest researchers and relevant 
professionals collaborate and use the fundamental elements of gamification design principles  
as a guide. We expect user testing and controlled studies to further help in the developmental 
phase of serious games, bringing light to the efficacy of chosen gamification techniques.
