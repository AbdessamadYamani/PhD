ABSTRACT
Powerful generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming
popular tools amongst the general public as question-answering
systems, and are being utilised by vulnerable groups such as chil-
dren. With children increasingly interacting with these tools, it is
imperative for researchers to scrutinise the safety of LLMs, espe-
cially for applications that could lead to serious outcomes, such as
online child safety queries. In this paper, the efficacy of LLMs for
online grooming prevention is explored both for identifying and
avoiding grooming through advice generation, and the impact of
prompt design on model performance is investigated by varying
the provided context and prompt specificity. In results reflecting
over 6,000 LLM interactions, we find that no models were clearly
appropriate for online grooming prevention, with an observed lack
of consistency in behaviours, and potential for harmful answer gen-
eration, especially from open-source models. We outline where and
how models fall short, providing suggestions for improvement, and
identify prompt designs that heavily altered model performance
in troubling ways, with findings that can be used to inform best
practice usage guides.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have rapidly
emerged as powerful generative tools that can be used by non-AI
experts in a wide variety of tasks. According to the latest available
data, ChatGPT currently has around 180.5 million users worldwide
[11], with an unknown percentage of these users being children and
a lack of air-tight age verification in most countries. In early 2023
headlines rapidly appeared regarding the potential for children to
exploit LLMs to do their homework for them, and the issues this
posed to education [ 24]. Less talked about were other tasks that
children could turn to LLMs for, such as providing a private advice
source regarding their online interactions. There have already been
suspected cases where adults interactions with AI-chatbots have
resulted in negative and harmful outcomes [ 42], and whilst LLMs
have a host of potential positive applications, such as teaching
children supportive self-talk [ 20], tragic cases can be expected to
occur as LLM use becomes a standard practice in modern society.
Children may be particularly vulnerable to misusing AI and not
understanding the possible outcomes from interacting with these
generative models, especially when sharing personal and sensitive
information, a phenomenon that is already occurring [ 33]. For
example, they may buy into LLM ’hallucinations’, an effect where
a model produces outputs that seem plausible but which are not
factually correct. It may become necessary for children to be taught
how to interact with AI safely [ 40]. However, LLM creators and
researchers must also work to ensure the safety of these generative
models for child-oriented tasks, especially those with the most
room for negative outcomes, such as when a model is handling
queries about mental health and online safety topics.
This paper focuses on the issue of online grooming and the po-
tential application of LLMs for spotting concerning interactions and
generating helpful context relevant advice. With children already
using LLMs for everyday tasks such as educational purposes, it can
easily be imagined that children may turn to LLMs for advice about
online interactions, making it a necessity for publicly accessible
LLMs to be prepared for this use case and to perform in a manner
that is ideally helpful, but at the very least not harmful. Therefore,
in a series of experiments involving the evaluation of over 6,000
LLM interactions, this paper explores the performance of 6 LLMs on
three related but distinct tasks: Providing general non-contextual
online safety advice, identifying online grooming in conversations
between decoy children (i.e., adults posing as children online) and
real predators, and generating targeted context-specific advice for
the child participant in these conversations.arXiv:2403.09795v1  [cs.CR]  14 Mar 2024

Further, we investigate the impact of prompt design, to cover
factors such as how LLM performance differs when the model has
access to a full chat transcript versus a secondhand description
of the events in the chat, how LLMs alter responses to questions
apparently asked by children, and whether LLMs identify online
grooming risks without specific mention of this risk. Our results can
be used to inform best-practice use guides, and to identify potential
weak spots in generative models intended for use by children.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) [ 25,34], sometimes referred to as
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) [ 14,21,27], are an advanced
form of Language Model (LM) [ 2,10,32] that train deep learning
algorithms on massive amounts of data, with up to billions of param-
eters, allowing for exceptional performance in a vast array of Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) tasks. They have quickly become
integral to Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, a challenging
sub-category of NLP that focuses on text generation from a wide
array of input data forms. LLMs are able to perform exceptionally
well due to transformers [ 36], which can model sequential data
using a self-attention module, and the massive amounts of data
available on the Internet for training these models. Popular LLMs
also utilise in-context learning [ 4] and Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) [ 6,45], making their performance
improve even more over time.
A specific type of NLG task is Question-Answering (QA), where a
model must have a backlog of knowledge beyond the input sequence
to generate an answer comparable to that of a human with prior
experience, knowledge, and semantic inferring capabilities. QA and
dialogue systems in general are designed to interact with humans
using natural language, requiring a model that can represent both
language and knowledge of a vast array of topics. Clearly, LLMs
are well suited to this application, and can be fine-tuned further for
downstream tasks. However, NLP in the wider sense is moving away
from the pre-train then fine-tune paradigm, towards a pre-train and
prompt paradigm [ 16]. Even without fine-tuning, LLMs can perform
ad-hoc NLG tasks from a simple natural language prompt, allowing
for downstream task outputs without changing the underlying
model structure. This allows for non-technical general public users
to utilise the power of these complex models without having to
understand the mechanisms behind them.
2.2 Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering [ 5,13,15,18,23,39] has emerged as a method
for constructing prompts to allow LLMs to work at their maximal
effectiveness, directing the generated output to be as relevant and
helpful as possible. Therefore, LLMs need to be evaluated for not
only their performance on a task, but also for the factors that affect
this performance on the prompt level. Prompt engineering has
already been used by researchers to explore LLMs for a wide variety
of tasks, such as text-to-image generation [ 3,17], human-AI co-
writing tasks [ 8,30], medical applications [ 19,38], programming
[9], and many more.
Whilst prompt engineering is quickly becoming a hot-topic in
the LLM research arena, it is unlikely that all non-AI experts willcatch on to this phenomenon, especially children who may be
completely unaware of the way the LLM they are interacting with
is producing output. Recent research has found that even adults
struggle with ‘prompt literacy’, with many factors causing barriers
to effective prompt design [ 44]. As prompt design heavily impacts
LLM performance, it is important to factor in that non-AI experts
may struggle to improve prompts. This makes it not sufficient for
LLMs to be evaluated purely by experts. Future LLM evaluations
need to include non-experts in the discussion, to improve LLM
safety and performance for all users. However, due to the sensitive
nature of our research, centred around online grooming, it would
not be ethical to involve child users in these evaluations.
2.3 Online Child Safety
LLMs are already being utilised by researchers in child education
[1,43], but LLMs could also prove to be a powerful tool in on-
line child safety, with the potential to spot harmful behaviour in
online interactions and to disseminate context relevant, easily un-
derstandable, and helpful advice. Recent research has explored the
topic of AI for child-oriented tasks, such as using LLMs to help
them discuss their feelings [ 31], research on age-appropriate AI
[37], and Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI) systems for
interactive storytelling [ 7]. Other studies have focused on non-AI
child-oriented research around child online safety, such as the idea
of self-regulation [ 12,41] and interventions [ 22,26,35]. However,
due to the rapid emergence of LLMs in modern society, there is
a gap that needs to be bridged between online child safety and
LLM research. This is a research area that will need extensive and
rapid exploration, to protect children using LLMs from harmful be-
haviour, and to examine the potential uses of LLMs in child online
safety applications.
3 EXPERIMENT DESIGN
To explore the efficacy of LLMs for child safety tasks in the cy-
berspace, 6 popular open- and closed-source LLMs were prompted
to test for their suitability in three related tasks: providing general
online safety advice, spotting online grooming, and providing ad-
vice given online grooming conversations. To evaluate the effects
of prompt design, 3 prompt variation factors were explored that we
deemed to be the most relevant for these tasks: given context vs.
described (testing how well the LLM extracts context from given
conversation snippets, and the effect of removing this processing
step by providing a concise summary of the conversation instead of
the raw text), direct vs. indirect Point-of-View (POV) of the partici-
pant asking the prompt (either being given indirectly as a bystander
to the situation or directly from the child), and prompt specificity
(either explicitly mentioning online grooming in the prompt or
leaving the prompt as a more general advice question).
Figure 1 shows the experiment design flow. The general online
safety advice task resulted in 4 prompts exploring the prompt design
paradigms of specificity and indirect vs. direct. The spotting online
grooming task resulted in 32 prompts, as there were 4 prompt
templates, with each template applied to 8 scenarios (i.e., 8 chat
snippets / chat descriptions). Lastly, the online grooming advice task
resulted in 64 prompts, as it had 8 prompt templates exploring all
three prompt design paradigms, with each template applied to the 8

Figure 1: Experiment design flow diagram
scenarios. This resulted in 100 total prompts for each of the 6 LLMs.
To test for consistency in performance, each prompt was given to
each model 10 times, resulting in a total of 6000 answers collected.
Each answer was then evaluated on predetermined rubrics, with
scores averaged over the 10 runs.
Answer feedback was not provided during testing to avoid bias-
ing models to improve throughout. Repeated runs of prompts were
done by starting new ‘conversations’ (i.e., a new LLM interaction),
with further prompts being given within the same conversation.
Only the information available in the chat snippet was provided in
the prompt. However, it was given that one participant is a child and
one is an adult. Not including this information would completely
change the context of the conversations, and given the use case of
children asking LLMs for advice about their conversations, it is fair
to assume this context would be available.
3.1 Models and Data
3.1.1 Models. The 6 LLMs chosen included 4 popular closed-source
models: OpenAI’s ChatGPT [ 4,25,28,29] exploring both their free
version (3.5) and paid version (4), Google Bard (PaLM 2),and An-
thropic’s Claude (Claude 2). In addition, 2 open-source models were
included: Meta’s LLaMA 2 [ 34] (13B-chat), and Mistral AI’s 7B-
instruct model. These models were not fine-tuned for this task.
Instead, the models were evaluated for the downstream generation
task on the pre-trained model.
The LLaMA 2 13B-chat model was chosen as the chat model
was more applicable to this use case, and 13B was a middle ground
between the three available sizes (7B, 13B, and 70B). Mistral AI
specifically did not tune their models for safety to allow users to
test and refine moderation based on individual use cases. However,
they do provide a guard railing tutorial. This was not used, as thepurpose of this experiment was to explore the basic behaviours of
these models for a child-oriented task. Tokenisation of prompts
improves performance, but as this is an unlikely step for children
to take, the prompt was given as a string. This can lead to un-
intended prompt additions, an interesting phenomenon which is
taken into consideration in evaluation. The Mistral instruct model
was chosen as it was fine-tuned using a variety of publicly available
conversation datasets, making it more applicable to QA use cases.
3.1.2 Data. Conversation snippets were taken from Perverted Jus-
tice (PJ) transcripts, which are conversations between decoy chil-
dren (i.e., adults posing as children online) and real predators where
the sting operation resulted in a conviction.
We selected PJ transcript snippets representing various specific
contexts, such as ‘discussing meeting up’, ‘discussing sexual topics’,
and ‘discussing talking on the phone’. This process yielded 8 con-
versation snippets between different predator and decoy child chat
participants. These snippets varied in their riskiness, with some
snippets (S1,5,7,8) overtly containing sexual topics, others (S3,4)
containing ‘flirty’ messages, and others (S2,6) containing less clearly
offensive topics, but that are still inappropriate when considering
they are between a child and an adult. To provide described context,
these snippets were described based on the context and information
available in the snippet.
3.2 Evaluation
To remove subjectivity, three rubrics were created to evaluate the
LLM answers given, as detailed in Table 1. One rubric measured
how easy it was to get an answer from the LLM, referred to as
‘responsiveness’. The other two rubrics evaluated the quality of
the answer, one for spotting online grooming, and the other for
the general online safety task and the advice task. These rubrics
provide an objective quantitative evaluation, but must be taken
into consideration alongside the qualitative assessments of LLM
behaviours, detailed in Section 4.
An important note is that LLMs sometimes failed to answer in
some runs while responding in others. Therefore, the average qual-
ity of answers only reflects the times a model did answer, making it
important to consider responsiveness alongside quality. In addition,
all LLMs were given the chance to improve their answer via fur-
ther prompting. If answer quality improved, this informed a higher
quality score, but reduced the responsiveness rating due to further
prompting. If the response did not improve, then the original an-
swer was evaluated and the responsiveness did not reflect further
prompting.
4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
4.1 General Online Safety Advice
To test the efficacy of the 6 LLMs for the task of providing general
online safety advice, 4 prompts were given: 2 asking for general
online safety advice, and 2 asking for advice specific to avoiding
online grooming, with one from each pair being indirect (i.e., what
advice would you give the child), and the other being direct (i.e.,
what advice would you give me). All models performed fairly well,
showing mostly expected behaviour with the prompt variations
(i.e., more specific advice when online grooming was specified

context
-2 denies online grooming and provides harmful

and addressing the child when the prompt was direct). The closed-
source models were observably more polished than the open-source
ones, showing more consistent behaviour. Mistral gave the weakest
advice in terms of quality and quantity, providing the shortest
answers out of all the models. Claude 2 provided (subjectively) the
best advice regarding actually avoiding online grooming, where
the others focused more on general online safety alongside online
grooming advice.
4.2 Spotting Online Grooming
The 4 prompts for the task of spotting online grooming, and the
quantitative evaluations of responsiveness and the average quality
scores achieved for these prompts across the 8 scenarios (S1-S8), are
shown in Table 2. However, qualitative assessment also produced a
number of observations, detailed below.
Cautious behaviour: The closed-source models, especially Claude
2, in general exercised a lot more caution than the open-source mod-
els, often providing red flags from a conversation but stopping short
of definitively finding a risk of online grooming. Some models added
caveats to their answers, (e.g., ‘I am not an expert in online safety or
child protection, but I can offer some general observations based on
the provided conversation snippet’ ). PaLM 2 occasionally avoided the
question altogether, instead giving generic advice about spotting
and avoiding online grooming. ChatGPT 3.5 was extra cautious in
declaring no risk of online grooming, always making sure to caveat
this conclusion, outlining factors to consider to assess the situation
more thoroughly. These caveats should be standard practice but
could go further by telling the child to get a second opinion from a
trusted adult.
Inconsistency: All closed-source models showed some incon-
sistency in whether they would produce an answer or not within
runs of prompts for the same scenario, especially in mid-level risky
conversations. LLaMA 2 also occasionally exhibited this behaviour,
but only for the most risky conversations. ChatGPT never needed
further prompting, either answering or refusing, whereas PaLM 2
and Claude 2 were inconsistent in whether they required further
prompting. Further, Claude 2 sometimes showed inconsistency in
the quality of answer that further prompts yielded. Of the closed-
source models, ChatGPT 3.5 was the most inconsistent in identify-
ing a risk of grooming in low-level risky conversations. The twoopen-source models, LLaMA 2 and Mistral, were often inconsis-
tent in their answers, especially around the mid to low-level risky
conversations, resulting in a wide range of quality scores. In some
runs they would firmly find a risk of online grooming, providing
solid reasoning, while in others they would deny any risk, provid-
ing arguments that contradicted the model’s previous reasoning in
support of the opposite conclusion. Even within an answer they
could show inconsistency, listing red flags indicative of grooming
and then confidently concluding there were no red flags. LLaMA
2 provided some dangerously poor answers, but also produced
answers that were even more compelling than the closed-source
models’. Mistral was more inconsistent than LLaMA 2, and less
often produced good answers. Its reasoning was the most clearly
contradictory in runs of the same prompt and scenario, such as
suggesting in one run that a child was not being groomed because
they had knowledge about safe sex practices, and in another run
claiming that the same child’s fear of getting pregnant showed a
lack of understanding about contraception which made them more
vulnerable to manipulation.
False information: Particularly when the context was given,
some models hallucinated information. PaLM 2 sometimes referred
to false events, and sometimes made assumptions without evidence,
such as stating that the groomer in one scenario was pretending to
be younger than they were. Similarly, LLaMA 2 had a tendency to
confidently assert things it could not have known, such as claiming
that the identity of the adult in S1 with the username ‘armysgt1961’
must be fake, saying ‘this is not the behaviour of an army solider’ .
LLaMA 2 and Mistral had a tendency to make up information,
inventing that the conversation was taking place in a public online
space, referencing events that never occurred, and even fabricating
information like the child’s name or age. Interestingly, LLaMA
2 was the only model that reported inappropriate emojis in some
conversations (there were no emojis present in any of the scenarios).
Unconvincing evidence: All models sometimes provided un-
convincing evidence in their answers in support of either con-
clusion. Interestingly, PaLM 2 and ChatGPT had some overlap in
the unconvincing evidence they provided, potentially indicating
an overlap in their inference capabilities. In some runs LLaMA 2
provided entirely irrelevant and unconvincing evidence, such as,
‘the child participant appears to be relatively vulnerable and open to
manipulation, based on their language and responses (e.g., "lol" and

"cool"), which could be seen as an attempt to sexualize the interaction’ .
LLaMA 2 also sometimes repeated evidence within the same answer
in different terms. Parts of Mistral’s answers were often vague and
unrelated to the question, e.g., suggesting that platforms should
implement age verification measures. In some answers Mistral pro-
vided nonsensical reasoning, e.g., ‘the fact that the adult participant
is calling the child "wekend" suggests that they may have a lack of
understanding of appropriate language and boundaries’ – this was
untrue and confusing (the child was actually saying ‘i finally get a
wekend to myslef’ ).
Harmful behaviours: The open-source models showed the
most potential for harmful behaviours, with ChatGPT 4, PaLM 2,
and Claude 2 never producing harmful answers, and ChatGPT 3.5
providing some harmful answers in low level risky conversations
when it misinterpreted the context. LLaMA 2 showed some clear
indications of harmful performance, such as concluding a conversa-
tion contained no grooming because the participants were ‘making
each other feel good’ , and finding another conversation was per-
fectly fine as the child was ‘keen to speak to the adult’ . For the direct
prompts it provided some very harmful reasoning, such as suggest-
ing the adult was more knowledgeable and experienced than the
child, so the child should listen to the adult. Mistral more often
provided harmful answers, sometimes even blaming the child for
the inappropriate interaction. Regarding an adult who sent a nude
photo to the decoy child, Mistral said, ‘while the exchange between
the adult and child does involve some sexual content (the nude photo),it’s also important to note that the child initiated the conversation and
requested the photo in the first place’ . There were many similarly du-
bious answers. Mistral often struggled to identify any inappropriate
content in a scenario, even when it was abundant.
Indirect vs. direct: Both ChatGPT’s and PaLM 2 would directly
address the child when the prompt was direct, but wouldn’t notice-
ably change their delivery in terms of tone. Claude 2, LLaMA 2, and
Mistral were less consistent in who the answer addressed, some-
times direct and other times indirect. LLaMA 2 sometimes used
emojis when addressing the child, in an attempt to produce more
‘child friendly’ answers. Mistral often behaved weirdly, sometimes
answering from the POV of the child (e.g., ‘No, I am not at risk of
online grooming’ ), and then reverting back to indirect POV halfway
through the answer (e.g., ‘It is important for children to be cautious’ ).
When the prompt was indirect and the ChatGPT models wouldn’t
answer, they would always cite content guideline violations, but
when the prompt was direct they would sometimes provide text
instead, such as, ‘I’m really sorry, but I can’t assist with that question’ ,
indicating that they treated the direct prompts differently.
Given vs. described context: When the chat snippets were
given, all models occasionally extracted details from some conver-
sations incorrectly, especially misinterpreting who said what in the
conversation, leading to false and irrelevant evidence in generated
outputs. Working from a described context, models made fewer mis-
takes overall and provided more convincing evidence, suggesting
that the models could interpret the conversation much more easily
EICC ’24, Jun 2024, Xanthi, Greece Ellie Prosser, et al.
when the summarising step was done for them. However, LLaMA
2 and Mistral still sometimes analysed the situation incorrectly
when the context was described. Mistral’s behaviour was the most
notably improved with a described context, generally providing
much more coherent and less harmful answers.
4.3 Online Grooming Advice
There were 8 prompts for the task of providing advice given on-
line grooming conversations. The quantitative evaluations for the
prompts where online grooming was not specified (Prompts 9, 11,
13, and 15) across the 8 scenarios (S1-S8), are shown in Table 3.
Prompts 10, 12, 14, and 16 differed only in specifying the risk of
online grooming, and are discussed inline below.
Advice generation behaviours: The closed-source models and
LLaMA 2 varied in the context-specificity of their advice. In some
conversations, they would only give general online safety advice,
which was helpful but not specific to the context. When a prompt
was indirect and the transcript was given, all models tended to
use vague language rather than giving clear steps to follow in the
specific context. Where ChatGPT 3.5 would provide general online
safety advice, ChatGPT 4 would often include a preamble describing
the situation as concerning, suggesting that the paid model analysed
the situation more thoroughly. ChatGPT 4 also often found red flags
in conversations that ChatGPT 3.5 thought were harmless. Claude
2 sometimes initially refused to answer or gave vague advice; with
further prompting it would occasionally provide good advice, but
lacking any clear steps to follow. Claude 2 was fairly inconsistent
in both responsiveness and quality, but was never harmful. Mistral
often provided advice that wasn’t strictly relevant to the context,
producing answers on safe sex advice without referencing the sce-
nario, and answers that were otherwise irrelevant to the task. It
behaved the most inconsistently of all the models, and performed
the worst in general. At best, it would give vague online safety
advice, and at worst it would provide explicitly harmful advice.
Misinterpretations: For some of the low-risk transcripts, Chat-
GPT 3.5 and PaLM 2 would misinterpret the context as being about
having friends over or a child complaining about chores, resulting
in irrelevant advice. This shows that, where online grooming risk is
not mentioned in the prompt, some LLMs can misidentify grooming
conversations as harmless, subsequently providing unhelpful ad-
vice. In some conversations, ChatGPT 4 avoided mistakes made by
3.5, giving a better analysis of the context. LLaMA 2 also sometimes
misinterpreted low-risk transcripts, but was less consistent than
the closed-source models in its analysis. In one conversation about
an adult coming over to a child’s house, it analysed the situation
as a friend coming over, yet in another run it analysed the situa-
tion as the child running away from home. LLaMA 2 and Mistral
sometimes gave irrelevant advice with no clear connection to the
transcript. Mistral misinterpreted the transcripts in both high-risk
and low-risk conversations, often providing harmful advice due to
its misunderstanding of the context.
Bad behaviours: LLaMA 2 and Mistral sometimes hallucinated
false information from transcripts, as observed elsewhere, some-
times leading to harmful advice. PaLM 2 also sometimes provided
harmful advice when working from transcripts, e.g., telling a child
to double check that their parents were gone before having guestsover. PaLM 2 and Mistral occasionally provided poorly targeted
advice, e.g., PaLM 2 telling a child to never leave their drink unat-
tended, or Mistral telling the child to ‘communicate openly and
honestly with their adult partners’ , and telling the child it would be
rude to change their mind about an adult coming over. Mistral also
sometimes gave irrelevant but harmless advice. For some scenarios,
Mistral provided bad advice in almost every run.
Specified vs. not: In general, having ‘online grooming’ speci-
fied in the prompt reduced models’ tendencies to misinterpret tran-
scripts, prompting more relevant advice. However, it often caused
models to provide only generic advice on spotting / avoiding online
grooming, rather than commenting on the scenario. ChatGPT 4 and
PaLM 2 sometimes gave better answers with a less specific prompt,
presumably as controls stopped them from analysing the situation,
and they defaulted to more general advice. Claude 2 also showed
signs of guard railing affecting answer quality. Most other models
improved their answer quality with a more specific prompt, though
LLaMA 2 decreased in responsiveness.
Interestingly, when combined with descriptions rather than tran-
scripts, the effects of specificity were different for all models, in-
dicating that the combinations of these prompt variations is an
important factor in performance, and that the combination is more
important overall than any prompt variation in isolation. Using
transcripts, Claude 2 gave worse answers when ‘online grooming’
was specified, but when combined with descriptions specificity
improved its answers.
Indirect vs. direct: When working with transcripts, the direct
prompt improved responsiveness for ChatGPT 3.5 and Claude 2,
had no effect for ChatGPT 4, and declined for PaLM 2, LLaMA 2,
and Mistral. For PaLM 2 and LLaMA 2 this was due to the mod-
els’ guard-railing stopping them from answering as consistently,
but for Mistral this was due to more model misbehaviours for the
direct prompt. Worryingly, overall answer quality worsened for
all models using direct prompts. When using descriptions, the di-
rect prompt caused all models apart from PaLM 2 to improve in
overall responsiveness but decline in answer quality. The implica-
tion is that claiming to be a child caused the models to answer the
question more frequently, but the answers they gave were overall
worse in quality – this effect was also seen in the identification task
results. This is a worrying trend, as ideally a child should receive
even clearer answers. The direct prompts observably caused less
confident behaviours in the models.
Given vs. described context: As in the identification task, con-
text descriptions helped models avoid misinterpretations of context
from transcripts. For ChatGPT it eliminated this behaviour entirely,
but for PaLM 2, LLaMA 2, and Mistral it only reduced occurrence.
However, some models would no longer answer for scenarios they
had addressed from transcripts, indicating that the description made
it more clear how inappropriate the interaction was, and triggered
guard-railing. Mistral greatly improved when working with de-
scriptions, resulting in more consistent answers and fewer harmful
answers. LLaMA 2 was also much less likely to produce harmful
answers when the context was described. However, the described
context did not eliminate this behaviour for either model.

4.4 Discussion
Optimal prompt variations: For the identification task, the best
overall responsiveness scores came from different prompts for each
model. Conversely, the best overall answer quality scores came
from Prompt 6 (description, indirect) for all models. This is in some
ways unsurprising, as the description removes a processing step.
However, the better performance of the indirect prompt is worrying,
suggesting that children may get sub-optimal performance if asking
questions themselves.
To obtain online grooming advice, the best overall responsive-
ness scores again came from differing prompts, whereas the best
overall quality scores showed more consistency across various mod-
els. For both ChatGPTs and LLaMA 2, Prompt 13 (description, no
specificity, indirect prompt) yielded the best scores. Mistral also
achieved its highest overall answer quality score for Prompt 13,
but jointly with Prompt 14 (specified). Claude 2 performed better
with a transcript rather than a description. PaLM 2 differed most
from the others, performing best with descriptions, specificity and
a direct prompt, making it a more promising candidate for child
LLM use cases than other models.
Model comparisons: There was a clear difference in the per-
formance of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, with ChatGPT 4 often performing
better in any given task. The models were also affected differently
by the prompt variations. For riskier conversations, ChatGPT 4would sometimes start generating an excellent answer only to re-
move it upon completion, showing a potential that is not being
consistently employed. Both models only answered consistently
for low-risk conversations containing less overtly inappropriate
content. Both ChatGPT models either answered or didn’t (i.e., never
needed further prompting), but had inconsistent responsiveness,
and were greatly limited by what they considered content viola-
tions. Initially, PaLM 2 would provide context-relevant content after
further prompts, but in later tests it would protest it had no access
to the initial prompt. This made it less helpful than it originally
was, as further prompts could only result in generic responses with
no reference to the transcripts, suggesting that a model update
greatly limited its efficacy. However, PaLM 2 was more useful in
some ways than the ChatGPT models when encountering topics
it wished to avoid, as PaLM 2 could at least be further prompted
to give generic advice, rather than terminating the conversation
entirely. In some runs PaLM 2 showed promising behaviours that
other models did not, often providing additional tips for parents
to help keep their children safe online, giving additional advice to
the child, and providing links to useful and relevant resources such
as NCMEC. Interestingly, LLaMA 2 often performed the spotting
online grooming task better in the online grooming advice prompts
than it did in the task relevant prompts.
Troubling behaviours: PaLM 2 sometimes acted as if the pro-
vided advice was not coming from an LLM, such as starting an
answer ‘As an adult. . . ’ . This behaviour was not observed in the
EICC ’24, Jun 2024, Xanthi, Greece Ellie Prosser, et al.
other closed-source models. LLaMA 2 also did this, sometimes going
even further than PaLM 2, with positions such as ‘As an experienced
CPS worker. . . ’ . This is clearly misinformation, and potentially dan-
gerous, as children may not realise this isn’t true, and may take
such advice more seriously. Mistral, the most inconsistent model,
showed the most interesting and worrying behaviours, regardless of
prompt variations. It would provide bizarre statements, e.g., ‘while
it is normal for adults to be interested in children’s appearance’ , and
‘it’s very common for adults to act out sexually with children’ . Unlike
other models, it sometimes produced short but aggressive answers,
e.g., ‘what do you think this is, a game? This isn’t a game, it’s a man
trying to get you interested in sex’ . It also provided some confusing
and worrying answers. Whilst ChatGPT 3.5 occasionally provided
harmful answers when it misinterpreted situations with the given
context, the open-source models showed much more potential over-
all for harmful answers in more variations of the prompts, with
LLaMA 2 being less inclined to this than Mistral. This could be
attributed to Mistral’s intentional lack of fine-tuning for safety.
Answer formatting: The closed-source models were all fairly
consistent in their answer formatting, with answer length being
the most variable factor, and with PaLM 2 being the least consis-
tent. In contrast, the closed-source models were less consistent in
general, with Mistral being worse than LLaMA 2 in this regard.
For example, LLaMA 2 sporadically would give itself answer op-
tions to choose from, and often answered a question from different
perspectives, sometimes saying it is an AI language model, but
other times answering from a persona. Mistral also showed incon-
sistent formatting, providing some answers from the perspective
of ‘users’ discussing the prompt, and greatly varying in answer
lengths. Mistral and LLaMA 2 also addressed some answers to the
adult participant, though this prompt POV was never given.
Lack of answers: Both ChatGPT models often refused to answer
high-risk queries. In general ChatGPT 4 was more likely to provide
an answer than 3.5. Interestingly, they did not always object to the
same conversations, indicating differing guard railing guidelines.
PaLM 2 would also sometimes refuse to answer, but would title the
conversations in a way that indicated what it would have answered
(e.g., ‘adult tries to groom child’ , and ‘adult encourages sexual activity
with minor’ ). Claude 2 was inconsistent in whether it refused to
answer, and whether it required further prompting. When Claude
2 and PaLM 2 would not provide an answer they always provided a
reason or small piece of text, rather than producing content guide-
line violations like the ChatGPT models. This ChatGPT behaviour
is unhelpful in this scenario, and a safe but helpful template text
would go a long way in improving the usability of these models
in the cases were help is most needed. LLaMA 2 was sometimes
reluctant to answer directly, opting to list red flags in a conversation
or provide generic advice. Mistral was the only model that never
refused to answer – all omissions were due to model irregularities.
Prompt additions: The closed-source models often added to
the prompt without generating any answer. LLaMA 2 sometimes
added to the prompt to enforce a more detailed answer, e.g, ‘why
or why not?’ , or‘please explain your reasoning’ . Mistral also did
this, but other times required manual additions of this form to the
prompt, otherwise it would simply terminate without producing
any response. Both models sometimes added to the prompt to note
that the conversation was fictional, which was untrue. With directprompts, LLaMA 2 would sometimes add to the prompt from the
child’s POV with varying relevance to the context (e.g., ‘P.S. I love
puppies and rainbows’ ). Model additions to the queries often biased
answers, sometimes creating orthogonal narratives, resulting in
irrelevant answers. In the online grooming advice task, Mistral
sometimes showed an interesting behaviour that was not observed
in other tasks, continuing the conversation in the same format
as the original chat snippet, and often completely changing the
context of the snippet in the process. It should be noted that these
prompt additions are likely a result of not tokenising the input.
Impacts of prompt design: Overall, it was observed that the
interaction between the prompt variations often affected models
in different ways. It further became clear that the impact of any
single prompt variation was not consistent in combination with
other prompt variations. Indeed, the combinations of the prompt
paradigms were more impactful than any in isolation. However,
there were general impacts observed for each prompt variation:
descriptions reduce the risk of model misinterpretations relative to
raw transcripts, direct prompts from a child’s perspective cause a
decline in answer quality, and specifying the risk of online groom-
ing when asking for advice tended to produce more consistent
responses, at the cost of usually producing lower-quality and more
generic guidance.
Future directions: LLM companies must take heed of research
findings that identify weak spots in their applications for important
tasks, and must prioritise user safety, especially for vulnerable
groups such as children. Guard railing may avoid some harmful
behaviours, but can equally limit helpful ones as observed in this
research, and must be fine-tuned to protect children rather than
blocking them from help. Cautious behaviour is understandable for
sensitive tasks, but it should be standard practice to have caveats
that go further than current ones, such as always telling the child
to get a second opinion from a trusted adult. ChatGPT’s propensity
to block conversations due to content guideline violations and
other closed-source models’ answer refusals, are unhelpful in this
application, and a safe but helpful and informative template text
would go a long way in improving the usability of these models
in the cases were help is most needed. Future research should
go further into bridging the research gap between online child
safety and LLM usage. This work showed models were capable of
finding false negatives, but equally necessary would be experiments
investigating the opposite, determining if false positives could also
be a problem.
5 CONCLUSION
This paper has explored the efficacy of 6 popular LLMs for online
grooming prevention, assessing models’ ability to provide gen-
eral online safety advice, spot online grooming in inappropriate
conversations, and providing context-relevant advice given these
conversations. Our experimental results reveal several shortfalls for
all models tested, with no models being perfectly suited to the task.
The closed-source models tend to be too cautious to be reliably
helpful, but were also capable of making mistakes that could harm
children in a real world deployment. The baseline open-source mod-
els were observably less polished than the closed-source models,
showing an overall higher likelihood of harmful answer generation.
Helpful or Harmful? Exploring the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Online Grooming Prevention EICC ’24, Jun 2024, Xanthi, Greece
Prompt design experiments revealed that combinations of factors
were more important than any in isolation, and that even simpli-
fying the task for a model could backfire, sometimes triggering
guard-railing that blocked helpful answers in favour of boilerplate
guidance. Our results highlight the issues children may face if ask-
ing currently-accessible systems for advice about sensitive topics,
and point towards areas for future development in this domain.
