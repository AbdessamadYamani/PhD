(2020-2024)
Daijin Yang, Erica Kleinman, and Casper Harteveld
Abstract—Due to GPT’s impressive generative capabilities, its
applications in games are expanding rapidly. To offer researchers
a comprehensive understanding of the current applications and
identify both emerging trends and unexplored areas, this paper
introduces an updated scoping review of 131 articles, 76 of
which were published in 2024, to explore GPT’s potential for
games. By coding and synthesizing the papers, we identify five
prominent applications of GPT in current game research: procedural content generation, mixed-initiative game design, mixedinitiative gameplay, playing games, and game user research.
Drawing on insights from these application areas and emerging
research, we propose future studies should focus on expanding
the technical boundaries of the GPT models and exploring the
complex interaction dynamics between them and users. This
review aims to illustrate the state of the art in innovative GPT
applications in games, offering a foundation to enrich game
development and enhance player experiences through cuttingedge AI innovations.
Index Terms—GPT, Game, Large Language Model (LLM)
I. INTRODUCTION
THE advent of large language models (LLMs) presents
new opportunities for games. Leveraging their powerful
natural language processing and generative capabilities [1],
LLMs have demonstrated remarkable versatility across various applications [2], including information extraction [3],
question-answering [4], [5], text generation [6], programming
tasks [7], and creativity support [8], [9]. This versatility underscores their potential to impact various aspects of games [10],
where many tasks — such as programming, story writing,
and game-player interactions — involve a large amount of
text-based work. Moreover, the unique generative capabilities
of LLMs present distinct opportunities for both game design
and gameplay, enabling them to potentially move beyond preset, mechanical content and introduce innovative, dynamic
elements that bring fresh ideas to both game designers and
players.
Among all LLM models, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series — including GPT-2 [11], GPT-3 [12],
ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 [1] — has seen the most
frequent and widespread applications in games [10]. This
is largely due to their early release dates [2], [13] and
superior performance [14], [15]. Given GPT’s strong language
processing capabilities [1], [12], it has been extensively used
to generate and manage text-based game content, such as

character dialogue [75] and entire stories [76], and employed
for creative purposes, such as generating design ideas for board
games [77] or assisting with programming [78], [79].
As the use of GPT in games continues to expand
rapidly [10], reviewing emerging cases can help researchers
differentiate between recent developments and earlier work, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the current
state of GPT in gaming and highlighting key trends and gaps.
While existing reviews have explored the application of LLMs
in games, they often lack systematic searches of published
studies [16], focus on a single application area [17], [18], or
miss recent research [19], potentially overlooking significant
cases from major databases. Our previous review [10] of
55 GPT-for-games papers included a systematic search of
mainstream databases but did not capture the most recent
studies. Thus, an updated review that incorporates the latest
research is essential to provide researchers with a current and
informed perspective.
In this work, we extend our previous review [10] using the
same methodology. We identified 76 new articles that were
published in 2024 and incorporated them into this updated
version, resulting in 131 papers. Through open coding of the
new papers and classifying the generated codes, we did not
identify any new use case categories compared to our previous
review. Consequently, we assigned these papers to the existing
five categories: procedural content generation, mixed-initiative
game design, mixed-initiative gameplay, playing games, and
game user research. For each category, we present relevant
examples, highlight the trends and differences between recent
and earlier studies, and suggest new directions.
II. METHODOLOGY
In our review, we used the keywords “game” and “GPT”
to search for relevant articles across the following databases:
ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Springer, and AAAI.
These databases were selected due to their strong reputation
in computer science and AI research, offering comprehensive
access to papers focused on games and GPT [20], [21]. For
ACM, IEEE, and Springer, we performed searches directly
through the search engines on their respective websites. However, for AAAI papers, since the AAAI online library lacks
an advanced search function, we used Google Scholar as an
alternative, restricting the results to articles from aaai.org. In
all cases, we conducted full-text searches within the databases.
As shown in Figure 1, the preliminary search using the
aforementioned keywords resulted in 4,424 papers (2,326 new

time manipulation mechanics to a space shooter game that
originally featured only movement and shooting. GPT was
also used to assist in programming these mechanics. The
authors further conducted a user study of the improved games
and found that GPT’s suggestions enhanced the playability of
simple games and inspired human designers.
However, recent research has not yet explored combining
GPT with other technologies or design frameworks to generate
game mechanics, which we discovered in our previous review.
For example, in [143], GPT was leveraged to design gamified
mechanics for debugging and troubleshooting activities in
software engineering, using prompt engineering based on
Dal Sasso et al.’s [38] gamification design framework. [144]
used an evolutionary algorithm with GPT to create playable
board games. GPT generated a set of random game design
proposals, which were scored by players. Using tournament
selection [39], two designs were combined to form a new
proposal, and mutations were introduced to modify the design. This process repeated for 30 cycles, resulting in 40
game design proposals. Alternatively, in [77], GPT followed
the Design Sprint framework [40] for board game design.
GPT performed tasks in five phases: research existing games
(understand and diverge), create a constrained board game
(converge and prototype), reflect on the design (test), and
update the game based on reflections and player feedback
through iterative mixed-initiative interaction.
GPT assistance with programming tasks (n = 10, [78],
[79], [136], [145], [147]–[152]). Some studies [136], [145],
[147] have integrated programming support directly into tools
for scene creation or game mechanics development. For instance, the research discussed in previous sections on 3D scene
creation [136] and suggestions for basic game mechanics [147]
included code implementation and programming assistance
within their systems. Regarding programming assistance, [78]
provides a detailed account of the opportunities and challenges
of using GPT for programming support in VR development.
They found that GPT can significantly assist novice developers
by offering guidance on coding, troubleshooting, and feature
implementation, helping them overcome common challenges
in Unity-based VR development. However, for more complex
VR tasks, such as handling interactive elements and real-time
physics, GPT may provide inaccurate advice or incomplete
responses, requiring additional user oversight.
Beyond direct coding support, three examples are worth
mentioning [149], [151], [152]. In [149], the authors introduced GlitchBench, a new benchmark designed to test the
ability of multimodal LLMs to detect glitches in video games.
In this benchmark, the LLM must identify and report visual
inconsistencies or anomalies, such as rendering errors, object
misplacement, and physics glitches in game screenshots. The
authors found that GPT-4 achieved the highest accuracy,
although it could correctly detect only 43.4% of the glitches.
In the future, enhancing the model’s detection capabilities
could facilitate its use in game quality testing and debug
programming. In [151], the authors use ChatGPT to generate
reward functions for a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm [41] based on in-game information, assisting in
the training of DRL agents. ChatGPT first generates initial
reward functions based on textual descriptions of the game
and environmental variables. The DRL agents then interact
with the game environment using these reward functions,
gradually optimizing their strategies. In [152], the authors used
GPT-3.5 to generate dialogue data based on character and
scene cards, which provided detailed descriptions of personalities, speaking styles, goals, and obstacles within the Call
of Cthulhu (CoC) settings. These generated dialogues were
then used to fine-tune Baichuan-7B, a smaller language model.
This ultimately enabled Baichuan-7B to produce contextually
consistent, character-coherent, and narratively rich dialogues,
comparable in quality to GPT-3.5.
3) GPT for Mixed-initiative Gameplay: Unlike the previous
section, which leverages GPT to aid in design, this section
focuses on GPT as an aid during play. Compared to previous
years, 2024 has seen a significant increase in attention to
this category, with 24 new papers published. All except one
of these works utilize the latest models, including GPT-4,
GPT-3.5, and ChatGPT, aligning with our previous review’s
prediction that this category would trend toward using cuttingedge models [10].
GPT to aid story co-creation in games (n = 19, [153]–
[171]). Story co-creation involves players and GPT taking
turns to contribute to a story, adding sentences or paragraphs
to the narrative. The process typically begins with a prompt,
either provided by GPT or the players, to start the story. GPT
then generates new content by using the existing story as input
for its next contribution. For example, in [164], the authors
designed Snake Story, a story co-creation game combined with
the mechanics of the classic Snake game. As shown in Figure 8
GPT offers two text options based on the story so far, which
appear as food for the snake in the game. The player must
control the snake to “eat” one of the options, thereby adding
it to the story.
Fig. 8. Snake Story presented in [164]. Players will control the gray snake
on the left to consume one of the red and blue foods in (A). If the food is
eaten, the text on the food (D) will be added to the story (B).
In 2024, new research has started to move beyond simply
co-creating stories with GPT. For instance, in [162], the
author developed Eternagram, a story co-creation game that
assesses players’ attitudes toward climate change through story
co-creation. As players progress, they gradually develop a
future world devastated by climate change with GPT-4. The
research showed that this gamified approach could explore
players’ perspectives on climate issues in depth. In the context
of education, in [170], the authors developed Mathemyths,JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 7
where children learn mathematical language through story cocreation. The main plot structure is based on an “adventure”
genre, where children, alongside GPT-4, help the protagonist
complete tasks (like finding treasure) while answering simple
math questions (such as addition and subtraction) related to
the story. Similarly in the educational space„ [171] presented
Hacc-Man, a game centered around the concept of “jailbreaking” LLMs. Players interact with GPT through a retro
arcade-style computer, attempting to coax GPT into unethical
or unsafe behavior, such as tricking it into revealing another
patient’s health information in a hospital scenario. Overall,
these studies highlight the potential of GPT-driven games to
engage the public in reflections on and discussions about
serious topics.
GPT for providing feedback and guidance to players in
games (n = 12, [117]–[119], [172]–[180]). In 2024, feedback
and guidance, especially within educational games, have garnered significant attention, with all papers in this subcategory
published this year. For instance, in [176], the authors discuss
the integration of GPT into game-based learning environments
to offer personalized, subject-specific feedback on players’
in-game actions, answer their questions during gameplay,
and provide relevant explanations or demonstrations based
on the game’s tasks and learning content. The study shows
that players in GPT-assisted environments exhibit stronger
intrinsic motivation and cognitive engagement compared to
those in purely game-based settings. Additionally, some work
has combined this approach with PCG characters, as introduced in Section III-B1, allowing in-game characters to deliver
feedback rather than relying on an external system, which
enhances the game’s immersion. For example, in [119], GPT
takes on the role of Chang’e, the Moon Goddess from Chinese
mythology. Through correspondence with Chang’e, players
learn about astronomy and environmental science. Throughout
the interaction, GPT maintains the character’s linguistic style,
using phrases like “with lunar love” to reinforce Chang’e’s
identity and increase the believability of the character.
Aside from serious games, two works are worth mentioning.
In [175], the authors used GPT to simulate a player’s inner
monologue in a 3D creepy hotel game environment. When
players triggered events, such as opening doors or inspecting
objects, GPT-4 would generate insights, comments, or suggestions in the form of self-talk, aiding the player’s progression
and advancing the narrative. In [174], the authors utilized GPT3.5 to handle natural language commands given by players
to NPCs, adjusting the NPCs’ strategic priorities accordingly.
For instance, when a player says, “protect me,” the system
increases the priority of defensive goals for the NPC. In all,
these works demonstrate the potential of GPT to transform
gameplay and enhance the overall player experience.
GPT to support game masters (n = 3, [181]–[183]). In
this category, with one new study published in 2024 [183],
GPT was applied to assist Game Masters (GMs) in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) or other tabletop role-playing games
(TTRPGs). These studies explored how GPT-3 and ChatGPT
can provide creative support by generating enemy descriptions
and configurations, summarizing game scenarios, and brainstorming narrative elements. For instance, in [181], GPT-3 was
used to simplify and summarize the descriptions of monsters
from the D&D rulebook, helping DMs quickly grasp key
details. Additionally, ChatGPT was employed to assist DMs
in brainstorming encounter storylines. The authors developed
separate interfaces for each function and created distinct
prompts to enable GPT to perform these tasks effectively.
Notably, in a recent study [183], the authors explored the use
of ChatGPT as an independent GM for D&D without human
assistance. They configured different characteristics for GPTbased GMs, including a base model, one agent inclined to
support any player requests, and another that adhered strictly
to the original story settings. The results showed that both
specialized agents enhanced player experience compared to the
base model, highlighting new potential interactions between
GPT, GMs, and TTRPG players.
4) GPT as a Game Player: Works in this category explored
how GPT can autonomously play games or serve as a virtual
opponent. In 2024, most work (n = 7) used the latest GPT
models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, except one that used
GPT-2. In previous years, most of the work (n = 4) in this
category utilized GPT-2.
GPT for playing text-based games (n = 10, [184]–
[193]). In 2024, six studies explored GPT playing text-based
games, focusing on logical reasoning and social cognition.
For instance, in [109], the authors used prompt engineering
to enable GPT-4 to play Codenames, a cooperative wordguessing game. In this game, one agent provides clues to help
another agent guess target words. The research revealed that
while different prompts did not significantly impact GPT’s
reasoning or natural language understanding abilities, they did
influence its play style. In [190], GPT was tasked with playing
several games related to theory of mind [42] to assess its
social cognition. The authors found that GPT-4 demonstrated
stronger social reasoning abilities compared to models like
ERNIE-Bot [43] and ChatGLM [44], using social relationships
to infer the actions of others. Previous research has also
featured gameplay scenarios such as deducing a word from its
description [184] and compelling a defender to utter a specific
word while they attempt to avoid doing so [185].
GPT for playing non-text-based games (n = 4, [194]–
[197]). We identified four studies that utilized GPT for playing
various games, including 3 published in 2024 [194]–[197]
and one published in 2020 [194]. In [195], the authors introduced Verbal Apprentice Learner (VAL), a GPT-powered
system designed to learn from users through natural language
interactions. VAL was tested in a simplified version of the
cooking game Overcooked [45], where players guided it using
natural language instructions, progressively teaching it how
to perform game actions (e.g., picking up an onion, placing
it in a pot, turning on the stove). The results showed that
VAL could incrementally acquire knowledge from a small
number of examples and apply it to new situations. In another
example, [196] employed GPT to play a simplified version
of the card game Slay the Spire [46]. Game states such as
card draw information, mana consumption, status effects, and
deck descriptions were provided to GPT as part of the prompt
to assist in decision-making. The authors found that GPT
showed potential as an automated testing agent for card games,JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 8
potentially reducing the workload involved in game testing.
As a third example, in [197], GPT was used to play Angry
Fig. 9. An agent presented in [197] to play Angry Birds. GPT selects a target
based on game rules and scene data, then sends the information to calculate
the slingshot angle for launching the bird.
Birds [28]. As shown in Fig. 9, GPT first selects an appropriate
target based on the game rules and scene information (e.g., the
size, material, and coordinates of objects). This target information is then sent to a calculator to determine the slingshot’s
angle, enabling the bird to be launched towards the selected
target. The authors noted that while the system performed
well in simple scenarios, it needed improvement when dealing
with more complex firing strategies. Lastly, [194] presented an
approach where GPT-2 was used to generate plausible strategic
moves in the game of Go. By training on a dataset of Go game
records in Smart Game Format (SGF), the model learned to
mimic the strategic styles of Go champions, producing valid
and competitive game strategies.
5) GPT for Game User Research: Even with the inclusion
of six new papers from 2024, studies focusing on GPT for
game user research remain scarce, with only nine papers in
total addressing this category. These studies predominantly
utilize newer models, with GPT-2 not used in this category.
GPT for processing game reviews (n = 3, [198]–[200]).
This subcategory contains one new research from 2024 [198].
In [198], the authors used ChatGPT to generate recommended
reviews for the Ant Forest game, a mobile game that rewards
eco-friendly actions with virtual energy, which is then used
to plant real trees in reforestation projects. The study found
that recommendations generated by ChatGPT were perceived
to have higher content quality, and users tended to prefer
AI-generated recommendations over human-generated ones.
From the previous review, in [199], the authors explored
GPT-3’s potential to analyze game reviews to enhance game
design, focusing on how AI can provide insights into player
experiences and preferences by prompting GPT-3 to answer
questions from the Player Experience Inventory (PXI) [47]
based on players’ game reviews. In another example from
the previous review, [200], the authors investigated the use
of ChatGPT for categorizing audience comments during live
game streaming to increase engagement and stream value.
ChatGPT was prompted to classify audience members into
five predefined categories based on their comments and the
live streamer’s current game status.
GPT for analyzing player behavior (n = 3, [115], [201],
[202]). All three studies in this subcategory were from 2024
and feature studies in which GPT was used to examine
and assess how players interacted with a game. In [201],
GPT was employed to assess whether players’ actions in
a TTRPG aligned with their character settings. The authors
used controlled chain of thought prompting (CCoT) for the
purpose. First, GPT generated several possible behaviors based
on the character’s faction setting, then, GPT analyzed the
player’s actual in-game dialogue to check if it matched the
predicted behaviors. Finally, GPT was asked to summarize
its findings and develop a more general understanding of
the character’s faction. In [202], GPT was used to predict
players’ emotional shifts during a coin-flipping game. The
game involved four coin flips, with the likelihood of winning
or losing becoming clearer as the game progressed, causing
emotional changes. The study found that GPT performed well
in reasoning about the direction of emotional changes (positive
or negative) but struggled with predicting the intensity of
emotions and coping behaviors. In [115], the authors used
GPT to summarize interaction logs from a story co-writing
game. Based on these summaries, they built narrative graphs
to describe player behavior in the game. By comparing these
graphs with the original game narrative, they could identify
emerging nodes—new, unplanned strategies or interactions
introduced by the players. While these studies demonstrate
GPT’s potential to analyze and interpret player behavior in
unique ways, they also highlight its limitations in fully capturing emotional intensity and nuanced player strategies.
GPT for other game user research. (n = 3, [203]–
[205]). This subcategory contains two new research from
2024 [203], [204]. In [203], GPT-4 was used to classify
toxic messages in games. The authors applied the Prompt
Evolution Through Examples (PETE) method to optimize the
prompt. Specifically, the system started with an initial prompt,
generated variant versions, and selected the most effective
one based on performance in the task. Through multiple
iterations, the prompt was gradually optimized, improving the
model’s performance in toxic message classification. In [204],
GPT was used to recommend games to players. The authors
designed the LLaRA system based on GPT-4, which, unlike
traditional recommendation systems that rely solely on game
IDs, integrated textual information such as game storylines
and reviews. Additionally, LLaRA introduced complex user
behavior patterns, like playtime, allowing it to understand
user preferences better and recommend games that match
their style and interests. Additionally, in one study from the
previous review, [205], the authors investigated and compared
the answers of human participants and generative AI (GPT-4
and ChatGPT) to interview questions about voice interaction
across three scenarios: game-to-player, player-to-player, and
player-to-game interactions.
