\subsection{Generative AI in Education and Serious Games}

The integration of generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational settings, particularly within serious games, has seen a surge in interest. This intersection offers opportunities for enhanced personalization and more effective learning experiences but also comes with unique challenges that need careful consideration.

\subsubsection{Overview of Generative AI}

[A Comprehensive Review on Generative AI for Education] (Mittal et al., 2024) provides a thorough overview of GAI, positioning it as a technology that surpasses other AI and Machine Learning approaches by creating new content from existing data. This review highlights the various applications of GAI in education, which include creating educational content (text, images, videos), offering adaptive learning experiences, and supporting conversational interfaces. However, it also cautions about the need for careful implementation, as biases from the training data can be embedded into the final model, and that GAI requires a significant amount of computational power and a considerable amount of high-quality data.
This comprehensive overview is instrumental in understanding the potential and current limitations of GAI in educational scenarios, which helps researchers have a better understanding of what problems are to be addressed to achieve the optimal results.

\subsubsection{Serious Games in E-Learning}

Before implementing LLMs it is important to note the current state of serious games. [“A Review on Serious Games in E-learning”](Ning et al., n.d), provides a foundational understanding of serious games in e-learning. It emphasizes that serious games enhance learning through engaging experiences and challenges and by balancing entertainment with educational goals. The design of serious games must take into account the educational objectives and utilize elements such as game scenarios, mechanics, and technologies effectively. The paper also discusses how different types of games can promote different types of knowledge (factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive) when combined with learning goals and the revised Bloom's taxonomy. This review provides crucial information on serious game design principles, which can inform the integration of LLMs for more effective educational outcomes.

    \caption{LLMs for Game Content Generation and Customization}
    \label{tab:llm_content_generation}
\end{table}
Several works highlight the capability of LLMs to create customized and dynamic game content. For instance, [AI-Gadget Kit: Integrating Swarm User Interfaces with LLM-driven Agents for Rich Tabletop Game Applications] (Guo et al., 2024) showcases a system where LLMs control swarm robots in tabletop games, managing game rules and generating action sequences, demonstrating that LLMs can be used to execute complex interactions in a game setting. Similarly, [Game Generation via Large Language Models] (Hu et al., 2024) introduces a framework, "LLMGG," where LLMs generate both game rules and levels using VGDL from text prompts, showcasing their capacity for game design. On a related note, [Game Development as Human-LLM Interaction] (Hong et al., 2024) presents IGE, a framework that enables game development through LLM-human interaction using natural language input. These applications show the potential of LLMs to reduce the development time and complexity while also making game development more accessible for non-experts. [Procedural Content Generation in Games: A Survey with Insights on Emerging LLM Integration] (Maleki & Zhao, 2024) provides an extensive review of PCG and LLM integration and also discusses that with LLMs there is a shift in the research to applying the LLMs more than creating them. Further confirming that generative AI is an important part of PCG, [PROCEDURAL CONTENT GENERATION VIA GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE] (Mao et al., 2024) discusses different generative AI techniques such as GANs, Diffusion models and Transformers for PCG. These papers collectively emphasize LLM's potential in revolutionizing how game content is created, customized, and interacted with.


\subsection{LLMs in Game Design and Gameplay}

The use of LLMs in game design and gameplay has opened new avenues for more engaging and adaptive experiences, as described in Table \ref{tab:llms_gameplay_design}. This section explores the applications of LLMs in enhancing player interaction and game-play experience.

\subsubsection{LLMs as Game Agents and Game Masters}

LLMs' natural language processing capabilities can allow them to act as dynamic game agents and game masters. [GPT for Games] (Yang et al., 2024) provides an updated review of GPT's usage, highlighting its growing importance in areas such as mixed-initiative gameplay and game user research, and its ability to assist users with co-creation, feedback, or be used as game masters in TTRPGs. Similarly, [Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap] (Gallotta et al., 2024) outlines the potential roles for LLMs as players, game masters, and commentators.
These papers emphasize the versatility of LLMs for enhancing the interactive aspect of games through natural language interactions.
Moreover, this integration shows a potential for personalized and engaging gameplay for the user, which is beneficial in a serious game environment.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{LLMs as Game Agents and Game Masters.}
    \label{fig:llms_roles}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{LLMs in Serious Games Development and Game Balancing}

LLMs can enhance the development and design of serious games. [Large Language Models and Video Games: A Preliminary Scoping Review] (Sweetser, 2024) notes how LLMs support educators in serious game creation, brainstorming, selection and providing feedback. [Leveraging the Potential of Large Language Models in Education Through Playful and Game-Based Learning] (Huber et al., 2024) further suggests using LLMs to facilitate game creation by students or gamify teaching materials for educators. This showcases LLMs' potential to make educational game development more accessible and efficient. 
[LLMs May Not Be Human-Level Players, But They Can Be Testers: Measuring Game Difficulty with LLM Agents] (Xiao & Yang, 2024) introduces a way to use LLMs as game testers by creating agents that measure the difficulty of a game by correlating their performance to human players, thus suggesting their use in game balancing.
These papers indicate the significant impact LLMs can have on reducing the resources and time needed for game development and also improving the overall quality of the game.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{LLMs in Serious Game Development and Game Balancing.}
    \label{fig:llms_development_balancing}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{LLMs for Dynamic and Adaptive Games}

The integration of LLMs enables more adaptive and dynamic games. [GameEval: Evaluating LLMs on Conversational Games] (Qiao et al., 2023) introduces an evaluation framework that treats LLMs as game players, testing their integrated capabilities in diverse scenarios and it also shows that current benchmark methods used for evaluating LLM's performance fall short, while this one highlights the differences between several LLMs performance. Furthermore, [WeKnow-RAG: An Adaptive Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Integrating Web Search and Knowledge Graphs] (Xie et al., 2024) presents a RAG system that integrates web search and Knowledge Graphs to improve the accuracy of LLMs by using a combination of sparse and dense retrieval methods combined with an adaptive framework. This capability to generate more realistic and customized experiences shows promise for their use in the context of serious games.

    \caption{Challenges and Limitations of LLMs in Serious Games}
    \label{tab:challenges_llm}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Bias and Accuracy}

[A Comprehensive Review on Generative AI for Education] (Mittal et al., 2024) highlights concerns about biases embedded in GAI models due to their training data.
Also, [Can LLM-Generated Misinformation Be Detected ?] (Chen & Shu, 2024) underscores the ease with which LLMs can generate misleading information. [Helpful or Harmful? Exploring the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Online Grooming Prevention] (Prosser & Edwards, 2024) reveals that while LLMs can be cautiously helpful they can also be unreliable in identifying or preventing online grooming and may also generate harmful answers, sometimes blaming the child. These findings highlight the need for careful evaluation, monitoring, and design with focus on ethical and safety considerations when implementing LLMs in serious games, particularly when sensitive or educational content is involved.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Challenges Regarding Bias and Accuracy of LLMs.}
    \label{fig:bias_accuracy}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reasoning and Strategic Limitations}

[GTB ENCH : Uncovering the Strategic Reasoning Limitations of LLMs via Game-Theoretic Evaluations] (Duan et al., 2024) demonstrates that LLMs struggle in strategic games, particularly in complete and deterministic games, showcasing the limitations in strategic reasoning and highlighting common errors. The paper [Large Language Models Playing Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium Games] (Silva, 2024) further illustrates this limitation, showing that LLMs struggle with finding mixed strategies in game theory scenarios without using a code implementation. These insights are crucial when incorporating LLMs in game design, emphasizing the need for alternative solutions for complex strategic interactions or the need to improve their reasoning capabilities for optimal use.

\begin{figure}[h]

\subsubsection{Technical and Ethical Challenges}

Several challenges are highlighted by [Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap] (Gallotta et al., 2024), including hallucinations, the lack of understanding of user intent, context limitations, and high computational costs. These issues emphasize that while LLMs offer many potential benefits, their deployment in games requires substantial technical and ethical considerations. These challenges also affect the trustworthiness of the system which must be address to use the LLMs in learning environments.
[CS1-LLM: Integrating LLMs into CS1 Instruction] (Vadaparty et al., 2018) presents the students concerns about overreliance on LLMs and their reduced confidence in coding without them.
