\section{Research Methods}

\subsection{Systematic Review Guidelines}
This systematic literature review (SLR) adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. This ensures a rigorous, transparent, and replicable approach to the study selection and analysis.

\subsection{Research Questions}

\textbf{RQ1: What are the primary areas of research concerning the economic impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?}
    \textit{Motivation:} Identifying the primary research areas allows us to understand the current scope of the field, highlighting key themes and the intensity of the research effort dedicated to them. This helps to see which topics are well studied and which have opportunities for future research.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SQ1.1:} What are the main research streams concerning the impact of AI on labor markets, including job displacement and creation?
        \item \textbf{SQ1.2:} How is AI impacting economic growth and productivity according to the reviewed literature?
        \item \textbf{SQ1.3:} What are the prominent sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) where AI is actively being researched and implemented?
        \item \textbf{SQ1.4:} What are the primary policy and regulation challenges in managing the economic effects of AI identified in the literature?
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{RQ2: What are the methodologies used to investigate the economic implications of AI? }
    \textit{Motivation:}  Analyzing research methodologies provides insights into how the field investigates AI's economic impact. Understanding these approaches can reveal the quality and robustness of evidence and point to potential methodological gaps or biases.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SQ2.1:} What quantitative methodologies, such as econometric modeling, are employed in the literature?
        \item \textbf{SQ2.2:} What qualitative methodologies, such as case studies or expert opinions, are used in the analysis?
         \item \textbf{SQ2.3:} What data sources are used to analyze the relationship between the AI and the economy?
        \item \textbf{SQ2.4:} What are the limitations of current methodologies in analyzing AI's economic effects, as identified in the literature?
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{RQ3: What are the key findings and debates in the literature concerning the economic impact of AI?}
    \textit{Motivation:} A deep dive into the findings and debates is critical to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is known, what is debated, and what remains uncertain. This helps to identify areas of consensus and divergence.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SQ3.1:} What are the major consensus findings in the literature concerning the influence of AI on job markets?
        \item \textbf{SQ3.2:} What are the main debates and conflicting findings within the literature on AI-driven productivity and economic growth?
        \item \textbf{SQ3.3:} What are the common arguments concerning policy recommendations for AI's impact on the economy?
         \item \textbf{SQ3.4:}  What are the gaps or limitations in current understanding of the economic impact of AI that the literature identifies?
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Mapping Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MQ1:} How many peer-reviewed articles have been published on the economic impacts of AI in total from 2000 to 2024, and how does this trend evolve over time?
   \item \textbf{MQ2:} How many of the selected articles focus on AI's effect on labor markets, economic growth, specific sectors, and policy?
     \item \textbf{MQ3:} How many articles used a specific methodology, like econometric modeling and case studies?
    \item \textbf{MQ4:} How many of the articles focus on AI impact on specific industries?
    \item \textbf{MQ5:} How many of the selected articles consider specific types of AI technology?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Citation Format}
Citations in this review will follow the format [PaperName], where PaperName represents the author or a short version of the title to easily locate the paper. For example, [Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014)] refers to the work by Brynjolfsson and McAfee from 2014.

This chart depicts the systematic search methodology based on the Kitchenham guidelines. The process begins by defining the research questions, then moves to a search using the specified databases. Then it moves to the filtering phase, quality assessment, data extraction and finally to reporting the findings of the study.

\subsection{Search Strings}
The search strings were developed based on the PICO technique (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) as follows:

\textbf{Population:} Economy, Labor market, Industries
\textbf{Intervention:} Artificial Intelligence, AI, Machine Learning, Automation
\textbf{Comparison:} Not applicable
\textbf{Outcome:} Impact, effect, growth, productivity, change, job loss, job creation

\textbf{Search Strings (combined using 'OR' within each component and 'AND' between components):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database search strings:} \newline
    (("Economy" OR "Labor market" OR "Industries") AND ("Artificial Intelligence" OR "AI" OR "Machine Learning" OR "Automation") AND ("Impact" OR "Effect" OR "Growth" OR "Productivity" OR "Change" OR "Job loss" OR "Job creation"))
    
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The search string was modified to fit each specific database format, when necessary, and applied across ArXiv, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, IEEExplore, and Web of Science.
