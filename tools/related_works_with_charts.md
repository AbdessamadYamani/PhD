\section{Related Works}

This section provides a comprehensive review of existing literature concerning the interplay between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the economy. We categorize the related works based on key themes, highlighting their methodologies, findings, and contributions to the field.

\subsection{The Impact of AI on Labor Markets}

A significant body of research focuses on the impact of AI on employment. \textit{Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014)} were among the early proponents of the idea that technological advancements, particularly AI, could lead to widespread job displacement, sparking debates about the future of work. Their analysis highlights the potential for AI-driven automation to substitute human labor across various sectors, but they also acknowledge the possibility of new job creation.
\textit{Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018)} adopt an economic model to explore this tension. They conclude that the effects of automation on employment are not predetermined but rather depend on various factors, including the kind of AI being implemented and the industries that are impacted. This emphasizes that policy and investments should be made to improve the economy to adapt for the AI revolution.

    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm, every node/.style={fill=white, draw=black, thick}]
        \node (ai) [rectangle, minimum width=4cm, minimum height=1.5cm] {AI-driven Automation};
        \node (job_disp) [rectangle, below left = of ai, minimum width=4cm, minimum height=1.5cm] {Potential Job Displacement};
        \node (new_jobs) [rectangle, below right= of ai, minimum width=4cm, minimum height=1.5cm] {Potential New Job Creation};

        \draw [->, thick] (ai) -- (job_disp);
        \draw [->, thick] (ai) -- (new_jobs);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Potential Impacts of AI-driven Automation on Labor Markets}
    \label{fig:ai_labor_impact}
\end{figure}

Another key discussion is on the nature of skills in the AI-driven workplace. \textit{Autor (2015)} analyses the polarization of job opportunities, noting how middle-skilled, routine tasks are increasingly automated, leading to a surge in demand for high-skilled creative and analytical jobs and lower-skilled service jobs. This polarization highlights the importance of skills training and education policies to adapt the workforce to future job opportunities, a point also made by \textit{Frey and Osborne (2017)} in their influential work. \textit{Frey and Osborne (2017)} use machine learning techniques to assess the susceptibility of various jobs to computerization. They create a large number of predictions, many of them worrying. They state that there is high probability that many existing jobs will be automated by AI.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm]
        \node (middle) [draw, rectangle, fill=gray!20, minimum width=2.5cm] {Middle-Skilled Jobs};
        \node (high) [draw, rectangle, fill=blue!20, above right = of middle, minimum width=2.5cm] {High-Skilled Jobs};
        \node (low) [draw, rectangle, fill=green!20, below right = of middle, minimum width=2.5cm] {Lower-Skilled Jobs};

        \draw[->, thick] (middle) -- +(0, -2cm) node[below] {Automation} ;
        \draw[->, thick] (middle.north east) -- (high.south west) ;
        \draw[->, thick] (middle.south east) -- (low.north west) ;

        \node [below=1cm of middle, text width=4cm, align=center] {\footnotesize Routine tasks automated};
        \node [above=0.5cm of high, text width=4cm, align=center] {\footnotesize Increased Demand};
        \node [below=0.5cm of low, text width=4cm, align=center] {\footnotesize Increased Demand};

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Polarization of Job Opportunities}
    \label{fig:job_polarization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{AI-Driven Productivity and Economic Growth}

Another critical area of research explores how AI might drive economic growth by boosting productivity. \textit{Aghion et al. (2019)} explore this using an endogenous growth framework, arguing that AI can drive long-term growth through innovation and increases in production efficiency. This growth is not automatic, it requires proper policies and infrastructure to be in place.
\textit{Cockburn et al. (2018)} find a correlation between AI adoption and increased productivity, they analyze the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on different sectors, and find that AI is more disruptive in sectors with high levels of routine tasks, leading to higher economic benefits. These findings are related to the findings of \textit{Autor (2015)}, by stating which kind of jobs AI is better used for.
 The work of \textit{Nordhaus (2015)}, with their analysis of historical technological change, states that technological progress is a key component of economic growth. In this context AI is included as a source of technological progress that can generate significant economic growth.

    \node (ai) [draw, circle, minimum width=2cm, fill=blue!20] {AI};
    \node (innovation) [draw, rectangle, below left=of ai, minimum width=3cm] {Innovation};
    \node (productivity) [draw, rectangle, below right =of ai, minimum width=3cm] {Productivity};
    \node (growth) [draw, rectangle, below = of innovation, minimum width=3cm] {Economic Growth};
    \draw [->, thick] (ai) -- (innovation);
     \draw [->, thick] (ai) -- (productivity);
    \draw [->, thick] (innovation) -- (growth);
    \draw [->, thick] (productivity) -- (growth);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{AI Impact on Economic Growth}
    \label{fig:ai_economic_growth}
\end{figure}


\subsection{The Role of AI in Specific Sectors}

Research also investigates the impact of AI in specific economic sectors, like health, financial services, and manufacturing. \textit{Goldfarb et al. (2018)} find significant productivity gains using AI in the healthcare industry, particularly with diagnostic tools and personalized treatment recommendations.
\textit{Bresnahan et al. (2002)} analyze how IT can improve production and supply chain management, highlighting how AI can optimize resource allocation and streamline operations. Specifically, \textit{Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000)} explore how information technology contributes to firms' productivity and growth. This is also an issue for AI, since it can automate some parts of IT operations and improves significantly its efficiency.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm, every node/.style={fill=blue!10, draw=black, thick}]
        \node (health) [rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {Healthcare};
        \node (finance) [rectangle, right=of health, minimum width=3cm] {Financial Services};
        \node (manu) [rectangle, right=of finance, minimum width=3cm] {Manufacturing};

        \node (ai_health) [below=of health, rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {AI Application};
         \node (ai_finance) [below=of finance, rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {AI Application};
         \node (ai_manu) [below=of manu, rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {AI Application};

        \node (prod_health) [below=of ai_health, rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {Productivity Gains};
        \node (prod_finance) [below=of ai_finance, rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {Productivity Gains};
        \node (prod_manu) [below=of ai_manu, rectangle, minimum width=3cm] {Productivity Gains};

        \draw [->, thick] (health) -- (ai_health);
          \draw [->, thick] (finance) -- (ai_finance);
        \draw [->, thick] (manu) -- (ai_manu);

        \draw [->, thick] (ai_health) -- (prod_health);
         \draw [->, thick] (ai_finance) -- (prod_finance);
         \draw [->, thick] (ai_manu) -- (prod_manu);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{AI impact in Specific Sectors}
    \label{fig:ai_sectors}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Challenges and Policy Implications}

The literature also emphasizes the challenges associated with the growth of AI. \textit{Tirole (2017)} discusses the role of regulation in managing AI's impact, stressing that while AI can offer great opportunities for growth, there are also risks, and its important that those risks are dealt with properly through appropriate regulation. \textit{Agrawal et al. (2018)} investigate the economic consequences of uncertainty in AI development, including the need for policies that reduce such uncertainties. \textit{Weitzman (2014)} focuses on the risks of high-impact events due to AI which can lead to catastrophic results if proper regulations are not put in place.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm, every node/.style={fill=red!10, draw=black, thick}]
    \node (ai_dev) [rectangle] {AI Development};
    \node (uncertainty) [rectangle, below left = of ai_dev] {Economic Uncertainty};
     \node (regulation) [rectangle, below right = of ai_dev] {Policy and Regulation};
    \node (risks) [rectangle, below = of uncertainty] {Potential Risks};

    \draw [->, thick] (ai_dev) -- (uncertainty);
    \draw [->, thick] (ai_dev) -- (regulation);
    \draw [->, thick] (uncertainty) -- (risks);
