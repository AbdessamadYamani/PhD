\section{Abstract}

This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the economic impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various domains, including labor markets, economic growth, sector-specific applications, and policy implications. By analyzing a range of peer-reviewed articles, this study identifies major research themes, methodologies, key findings, and ongoing debates. The review highlights AI's transformative potential while also pointing out the challenges and limitations of current research and proposes future research directions. The results show the transformative power of AI, with many benefits and also a need to study the potential downsides.

\section{Introduction}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the global economy, creating both unprecedented opportunities and challenges. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing research on the economic impacts of AI. It synthesizes findings from various studies to provide a clear picture of the key areas of focus, methodologies employed, and major debates in this evolving field. The study is structured around three primary research questions which are: the areas of research of the economic impact of AI, the methodologies used and the findings and debates regarding the topic, with each question divided into sub-questions.
