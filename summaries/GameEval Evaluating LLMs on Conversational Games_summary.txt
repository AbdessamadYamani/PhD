**Relevance to the Subject:**

This paper, *GameEval Evaluating LLMs on Conversational Games* [Qiao et al., 2023], introduces a novel framework for evaluating the integrated capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using goal-driven conversational games. This is highly relevant to the impact of LLMs on serious games as the games are a complex system, that often require many capabilities of the AI to make them immersive and beneficial. The paper provides insight into how LLMs behave in interactive scenarios, which helps the serious games community to understand better, in which cases the LLMs can be implemented. The paper also highlights the limitations of standard evaluation methods which can be used to create a better evaluation strategy, to better test the potential of these new technologies for serious games.

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**

*   **Problem:** Existing LLM evaluation methods are limited, falling into two main categories: reference-based or preference-based. Reference-based methods require ground truth, which can be costly, and are unsuitable for open-ended tasks. Preference-based methods rely on human or model evaluators, introducing biases or requiring substantial resources. Current methods also assess tasks individually, which does not measure integrated capabilities.
*   **Proposed Solution:** *GameEval* is introduced as a novel evaluation approach where LLMs are treated as players in goal-driven conversational games. These games require models to use diverse skills such as cooperative and adversarial strategies, multi-hop reasoning, and long-term planning.
*  **Games Designed:**  Three distinct games are presented: "Ask-Guess" (cooperative question-answering), "SpyFall" (adversarial role-playing to identify the spy), and "TofuKingdom" (cooperative/adversarial role-playing with different factions). Each game has specific evaluation metrics.
*   **Capabilities Evaluated:** The games evaluate various capabilities of the LLMs, including cooperative and adversarial strategies, specific knowledge, multi-hop reasoning, deceptive strategy, long-term planning, and instruction-following.
*  **Experiments:**  The authors conducted experiments with three foundation models: ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Text-Davinci-003 (TD003).  The results indicated that *GameEval* can effectively differentiate the performance of these LLMs, with GPT-4 demonstrating superior capabilities in all three games, particularly when planning questions or identifying the spy.
*   **High Discrimination Results:** GameEval shows high discrimination between LLMs, revealing that previous benchmark methods show minimal differences between models, unlike GameEval. 
*   **Qualitative Results:** The authors show that GPT-4 has superior planning and reasoning abilities in the Ask-Guess game compared to ChatGPT, that the questions that are asked by GPT4 seem to be more targeted in nature and are based on previous turns of conversation.
*   **Conclusion:** *GameEval* presents a new paradigm for LLM evaluation through conversational games, offering a more comprehensive assessment of integrated capabilities by removing the limitations of both reference and preference based evaluations. The authors will continue to expand and improve *GameEval* in the future.
