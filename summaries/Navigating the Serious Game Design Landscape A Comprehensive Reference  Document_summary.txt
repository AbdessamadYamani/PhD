**Relevance to the Subject (Exploring the Impact of the integration of Large Language Models on Serious Game):** While this paper doesn't directly discuss Large Language Models (LLMs), it establishes a crucial foundation for understanding the design principles and best practices within serious game development. This foundation is vital for later integrating LLMs effectively. For instance, LLMs could be used to enhance storytelling, personalize player experiences or automate content creation, but only if game designers understand core design principles in the first place. This paper provides that crucial context. It is therefore relevant because it helps to understand how a well designed serious game should be before adding the LLMs.

**Key Points as Written in the Paper:**

This paper is a type of "Reference Document" or "Conceptual paper" which does not provide primary research but reviews other studies and create its own guide.

**Abstract:**
*   Serious games are effective tools for interventions, especially in combination with online education or traditional programs.
*   Professionals lack the specialized design skills to create engaging therapeutic serious games.
*   The paper addresses how to educate professionals on the importance of game design for therapeutic approaches.
*   Two solutions are proposed: a flow chart or a reference document.
*   A comprehensive reference document is favored due to its adaptability.

**Introduction:**
*   Serious games are for training and education, incorporating gamification techniques.
*   Healthcare has increased interest in using games for mental health interventions and skill development.
*   There's a gap between therapeutic treatments and design practices.
*   Minimal literature provides a general guide on best gamification techniques, often tailored to specific sectors.
*   The paper seeks to bridge the understanding gap between designers and professionals in clinical/research roles.
*   The research question: How can we effectively communicate the significance of game design in supporting innovative therapeutic approaches of serious games?

**Methods and Material:**
*   Affinity mapping used to derive ten gamification design principles from 22 sources.
*   Twelve literature reviews of serious games were selected by clinical application.
*   Evaluated how each serious game aligned with the defined gamification principles.
*   Literature review on gamification techniques, game design, and user behavior.

**Gamification Design Principles:** (as defined in the paper)
1.  Clear Goals and Objectives:  Provide a focused direction and purpose for the user.
2.  Design Around Core Mechanics: Define simple and understandable gameplay actions.
3.  Maintain Game Flow and Player Experience: Use intuitive interfaces and personalize user profiles.
4.  Balancing the Game: Present challenges aligned with player ability, neither too easy or hard.
5.  Storytelling and Immersion:  Enhance player engagement using narrative and role-playing.
6.  Reward and Points System: Use rewards as a motivator and feedback mechanism.
7.  Regular Feedback and Reflection: Provide clear feedback for actions and encourage reflective thinking.
8.  Visual and Auditory Elements: Use engaging graphics and audio cues.
9.  Social Affordances: Use channels of interaction such as chats or leaderboards.
10. Playtesting: Use user feedback to improve the game.

**Guidelines for Best Design Practices:**
*   A flexible reference document is favored over fixed frameworks for efficient collaboration.
*  Three Frameworks are used :
    1. **Framework for Integrating Therapeutic Content into Serious Games** (P. Siriaraya et al. [15]) uses game and therapy world loop to integrate existing therapeutic activity with game elements
    2. **Motivation Engagement and Thriving in User Experience (METUX)**  (D. Peters et al. [45]) emphasizes the importance of satisfying basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, relatedness across six spheres of influence (adoption, interface, task, behavior, life, society).
    3. **Systematically Assess Serious Games** (M. Graafland et al. [18]) which gives 62 items across five main themes: rationale, functionality, validity, and data safety of a serious game.

**Conclusions:**
*   Clinicians/researchers may not fully understand gamification design landscape.
*   There is more to be explored with gamification and earlier research.
*   The intent is not a definitive list but rather how techniques inform professionals.
*   Professionals should use principles as a guide.
*   User testing and controlled studies needed to determine efficacy.
