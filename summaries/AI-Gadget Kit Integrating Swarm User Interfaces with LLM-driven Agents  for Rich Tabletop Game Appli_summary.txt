**Relevance to the Subject (SLR on LLMs in Serious Games):**
This paper directly relates to the subject by exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and enhance the interactive experiences in tabletop games. It specifically focuses on how LLMs can be integrated with swarm user interfaces (SUIs) to create dynamic and personalized gameplay, which is highly relevant to the broader theme of LLMs within serious games, particularly in terms of AI-driven behavior and player interaction. The paper provides a tangible example of how LLMs can be used to plan and execute complex interactions in a game setting, which is vital to this area of research.

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**
* The paper introduces **AI-Gadget Kit**, a multi-agent SUI tabletop gaming system.
* The system uses swarm robots as "gadgets" controlled by a multi-agent system.
*  The multi-agent system consists of meta-actions for robots, two LLM-based agents (Coordinator and Controller), and add-on prompts to enhance understanding and reaction capabilities.
*  The **Coordinator Agent** handles game rules and context, responding to user commands. The **Controller Agent** focuses on generating action sequences for robots using meta-actions and game context.
*  **Add-on prompts** are included for specific interaction behaviors (Object Actuation, Symbol Visualization, Non-verbal Expression, Scene Interaction) and interaction relationships (Apprentice, Competitor, Teammate, Designer) to enhance LLM performance.
*  The system architecture includes an SUI platform, a localization system, a server, and the LLM-based multi-agent system.
* The paper presents application examples such as a Soccer-Ball-Shooting game, a Turn-Based Strategy game, a "Yes or No" question system, and an Improvisational Theater example, which highlight the system capabilities.
*  The system attempts to address limitations of SUIs in terms of autonomous action planning by using LLMs.
* The paper discusses limitations like robot performance issues, LLM context length limits, and potential enhancements through more robust algorithms, hardware modifications, and specialized agents.
