This paper, a preprint type, explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into traditional time series (TS) modeling, addressing the gap where LLMs are often used as a primary predictive tool, neglecting mathematical modeling. The authors introduce LLM-TS Integrator, a framework that enhances traditional TS models, like TimesNet, with LLM-derived insights by maximizing the mutual information between TS representations and their textual counterparts created through templates. The method features a novel sample reweighting module to optimize sample importance for both prediction and mutual information losses via bi-level optimization. 

**Relevance to the Subject:** This paper is highly relevant to a systematic literature review (SLR) on the integration of LLMs in serious games.  While not directly about serious games, it provides a crucial methodological contribution on how to integrate LLMs in TS data analysis.  Serious games frequently involve complex systems that generate TS data (e.g. player performance, resource management).  This paper provides a way to use LLMs in the analysis of such data for game design, balancing or improving in game experience. The approach of extracting insights using both traditional models and LLMs can lead to enhanced understanding and improved outcomes within serious games.

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**

*   **LLM-TS Integrator:** A novel framework that effectively integrates the capabilities of LLMs into traditional TS modeling. Central to this integration is a mutual information module. 
*   **Mutual Information Module:** The core of this module is a traditional TS model enhanced with LLM-derived insights for improved predictive abilities. This enhancement is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between traditional model's TS representations and LLM's textual representation counterparts. 
*   **Sample Reweighting Module:** A module that addresses variability in sample importance by assigning dual weights to each sample, one for prediction loss and another for mutual information loss, dynamically optimizing these weights via bi-level optimization.
*   **Text Descriptions for Time Series:** The study proposes generating text description via a template enriched with essential background and statistical details pertinent to the TS, thereby enriching the LLMâ€™s comprehension of the TS context.
*   **Performance:** The method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across five mainstream TS tasks, including short-term and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.
*  The paper details different experiments like Short-term Forecasting using M4 Dataset, Long-term Forecasting using ETT, Electricity, Traffic, Weather and ILI dataset, Imputation using ETT, Electricity, and Weather datasets, Time Series Classification using UEA repository and Anomaly detection using SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT and PSM dataset.
*   **Ablation Studies:**  The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of the different modules proposed in the method.
*   **Traditional TS Models and Language Model:** The paper also explores the usage of different traditional TS models like ETSformer, Stationary and FreTS, and language models like LLaMA-3b, GPT2 and BERT and details that the proposed method enhance the models performances across them.

**Citation:** The paper named [LLM-TS Integrator: Integrating LLM for Enhanced Time Series Modeling] is a research paper presenting a novel framework in the domain of time series analysis, not of the literature review type.
