**Relevance to the Subject:** This paper, a **research paper**, while not directly about serious games, is highly relevant to the broader subject of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into interactive systems. It explores a fundamental capability of intelligent agents—strategic decision-making under uncertainty—which is crucial for the design of compelling and adaptive serious games. This makes this paper very important for any SLR that involves LLMs in Game theory, games design and serious games.

**Key Points:**

*   The study focuses on the ability of LLMs to identify Nash equilibria in games with a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (where players randomize their actions), like matching pennies and rock-paper-scissors.
*   It highlights that LLMs, despite having knowledge of these equilibria in their pre-existing training data, fail to implement the correct mixed strategies when prompted directly to play the games.
*   The paper finds a significant improvement in LLM performance when they are provided with the ability to run code and are prompted to utilize it for generating randomized choices.
*   It reveals that LLMs struggle when the randomization strategy is complex or slightly modified from standard scenarios. The LLM failed to find the randomization needed in the slightly modified games, even when explicitly prompted.
*   The paper uses the Mistral v0.3 model and the quantized Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B model for the experimentations with a focus on the Mistral v0.3 results.
*   The authors provide their code publicly in a repository: [https://github.com/alonsosilvaallende/LLMs_Playing_MSNE_Games](https://github.com/alonsosilvaallende/LLMs_Playing_MSNE_Games)

The findings show a dependency on LLMs having to use code generation to resolve strategic problems which can impact their integration in complex serious games, highlighting limitations and pointing to areas for future research, as well as making a point on the need to further develop LLMs so they can handle complex game strategies.
