**Relevance:** This paper directly addresses the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into games, a core concern of your systematic literature review. It provides a comprehensive overview of current applications, potential future directions, and the limitations of LLMs within the gaming context. This is extremely relevant for your topic as it gives the state of the art and the perspectives.

**Key Points:**

*   **Paper Type: Survey Paper**
*   **Introduction:** The paper begins by highlighting the rapid evolution of LLMs, transitioning from a niche NLP topic to a field with broad applications. It emphasizes that while this review won't focus on the inner workings of LLMs, it will explore their current use in games and future potentials.
*   **LLM Roles in Games:** The authors propose several roles for LLMs in games, including:
    *   **LLM Players:** Using LLMs as game agents that can play games through natural language. They are capable of understanding and reacting to game states described in natural language.
    *   **LLM Game Masters (GMs):** Utilizing LLMs to manage and guide gameplay, especially in tabletop or narrative-driven games, through keeping track of locations, NPCs, rules, and game states.
    *   **Commentator/Reteller:** LLMs can offer real-time commentary on gameplay or summarize audience interactions during live streams.
    *   **User Research:** LLMs can analyze gameplay logs and potentially infer player experiences or emotional states.
    *   **Game Design:** LLMs can assist with generating game narratives, and even design documents, and acting as a conceptual assistance.
    *   **Procedural Content Generation:** LLMs can generate game content like narratives.
*   **Games as Testbeds for LLMs:** The paper highlights that games provide complex, constrained environments perfect for pushing LLM research, especially in areas like spatial reasoning, planning, and long-term interactions.
*   **Limitations of LLMs in Games:** The authors discuss challenges that LLMs need to address in the gaming domain:
    *   **Hallucinations:** LLMs often generate plausible but factually incorrect information. This can affect the consistency of game world and the reliability of in-game assistants.
    *  **Understanding User Intent:** LLMs can struggle to capture sarcasm or nuances in user requests.
    *   **Context Limitations:** LLMs struggle with long-term memory and maintaining consistent narratives.
    *   **Cost and Responsiveness:** The computational cost and time required for real-time LLM processing pose limitations on their feasibility for many game applications.
*    **Ethical Issues:** The paper also outlines the ethical concerns, including:
    *   **Sustainability:** The carbon footprint of training and running LLMs.
    *   **Copyright:** Concerns over training data, generated content, and model ownership.
    *   **Explainability:** LLM's lack of transparency and difficulties understanding their reasoning.
    *   **Privacy:** The risk of user data being used without informed consent.
    *   **Biases:** LLM's inherit biases from training data, which can cause toxic behavior or stereotypes in games.
*   **Conclusion:**  The paper concludes that LLMs have potential to improve game experiences and design, but there are still substantial technical, ethical, and legal challenges to overcome. The authors identify research directions in the future.
