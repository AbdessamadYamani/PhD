**Title:** CAN LLM-GENERATED MISINFORMATION BE DETECTED ?

**Relevance to the Subject:**

This paper is directly relevant to the systematic literature review (SLR) on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Serious Games, as it investigates a critical challenge and opportunity arising from LLMs: their potential to generate misinformation, a critical factor when assessing trustworthiness in games. Understanding how LLMs produce misinformation and its detectability can have an impact on the design of serious games and how users interact with them, especially when these games handle sensitive information or require unbiased learning outcomes. The paper is a conference paper.

**Key Points as Written in the Paper:**

The paper introduces a taxonomy of LLM-generated misinformation, categorizing it by types (fake news, rumors, etc.), domains (healthcare, politics, etc.), sources (hallucination, arbitrary generation, controllable generation), intents (unintentional or intentional), and errors (unsubstantiated content, total fabrication, etc.).
The authors validate real-world methods for generating misinformation using LLMs, including hallucination, arbitrary, and controllable methods. They show that LLMs can be instructed to produce misinformation across diverse categories.
Through empirical studies, they reveal that LLM-generated misinformation is often more difficult for both humans and detectors to identify than human-written misinformation that conveys the same semantics. This indicates that LLMs can produce text that is more deceptive.
They discuss emerging challenges for misinformation detectors, noting the difficulty of obtaining training labels and the potential for malicious actors to scale LLM misinformation. Zero-shot LLMs are utilized in evaluations, reflecting real-world practicalities, and show that they too can struggle to detect LLM-generated misinformation.
The study explores countermeasures during the LLM lifecycle, covering the training stage (data curation), inference stage (prompt filtering), and influence stage (detection, public education) and implications of their findings on combating LLM-generated misinformation.
The research constructs a dataset (LLMFake) of LLM-generated misinformation for further study.
The paper concludes by highlighting the paradigm shift in misinformation production from humans to LLMs and the need for collective efforts to combat this phenomenon.
They also performed statistical significance tests to validate their findings.
