**Relevance to the Subject (Exploring the Impact of the integration of Large Language Models on Serious Games):** While this paper does not directly address serious games, it is relevant to understanding the general capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a complex, predictive task. Insights into how LLMs handle data, integrate external information, and generate forecasts in the climate domain can be relevant to understanding the potential for LLM integration in serious game environments, particularly when using these models to create dynamic, interactive environments, or personalized user experiences or using them for content generation. Understanding their biases towards historical average can be helpful in assessing its suitability in scenarios where accurate and dynamic changes are necessary in a serious game.

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**

*   The paper explores the capability of GPT-4o in predicting rainfall at short-term (15-day) and long-term (12-month) scales.
*   Experiments were conducted to assess GPT-4o's performance under different conditions: with and without expert data inputs.
*   GPT-4o, when operating independently, tends to generate conservative forecasts, often reverting to historical averages in the absence of clear trend signals.
*   Providing GPT-4o with expert model predictions (from a trained LSTM model) did not significantly improve results, suggesting GPT's internal knowledge dominates its inferences.
*   Indirect provision of regional climate factors (temperature) had limited impact on short-term predictions.
*   For long-term predictions, adding global teleconnection factors (e.g., Nino3.4, PDO, NAO) declined GPT's predictive accuracy, it seems that  GPT struggled to make use of this complex climate data, but when added with std information, it had better results.
*   GPT-4o's tendency to revert to historical averages limits its ability to capture trend shifts and extreme climate events.
* The Expert model (EM) a two-layer LSTM model achieves the best results in both long-term and short-term predictions.
