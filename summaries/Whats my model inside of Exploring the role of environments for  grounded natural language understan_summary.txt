**Relevance to the Subject:** This PhD thesis offers a deep dive into the role of environments in natural language understanding (NLU), a topic highly relevant to the ongoing debate about integrating large language models (LLMs) with serious games, where interaction with a simulated world is key. It presents a novel, environment-oriented perspective, challenging the dominant model-centric approach in current NLU research. The framework proposed in the thesis can help design better environments for training and evaluating LLMs in the context of serious games.

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**
This doctoral thesis argues that traditional NLU research overly focuses on models in isolation, neglecting the crucial role of environments. The author highlights that just as ecological cognitive science emphasizes the importance of the body and environment in shaping human cognition, NLU research should similarly consider the deep coupling between models and their interactive environments. It proposes a novel "ecological NLU" framework inspired by "the limits of my environments mean the limits of my language (models)". The thesis is broken down into three main parts:
1.  **Conceptual Framework:** This part synthesizes cognitive science, linguistics, reinforcement learning, and NLU to propose a new understanding of NLU emphasizing ecological factors. It points out that world model learning, metaphor comprehension, and mental simulation are vital for NLU and analyzes the shortcomings of current statistical language models like LLMs when it comes to these abilities.  The work emphasizes the lack of suitable evaluation benchmarks that can rigorously and realistically assess language understanding, which leads to hampering language grounding debates.
2.  **Practical Applications:** It develops training and annotation methods, using text-based game environments, for procedural text comprehension, such as in scientific protocols. It discusses the TextLabs environment where procedural texts are interpreted as instructions. It also introduces a new benchmark for commonsense reasoning. It presents "Breakpoint Transformers," a new neural network architecture designed to model intermediate semantic information in narratives, to enable capturing beliefs and knowledge state as it changes over time.
3.  **Epistemic Environments:** It explores the implications of an ecological perspective on environments for human collaboration and learning, criticizing centralized social media and proposing a new form of epistemic environment supported by decentralized AI-augmented collective intelligence networks. The study introduces stigmergy as the basic mechanism for a decentralized social network where the platform only serves to provide markers that enable users to discover other user’s work.

**Citation and Paper Type:** The paper is a PhD Thesis, and when it is cited, it will be referred to as [What’s my model inside of Exploring the role of environments for grounded natural language understan].
