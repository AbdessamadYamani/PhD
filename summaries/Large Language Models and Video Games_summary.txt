**Relevance to the subject of Exploring the Impact of the integration of Large Language Models on Serious Games:** This paper is highly relevant as it specifically reviews the current research landscape of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in video games, including a section focused on serious games and game-based learning. It identifies how LLMs are being explored to aid in the development and design of such games, making it directly applicable to the topic of your systematic review.

**Key points from the paper [Large Language Models and Video Games] (Scoping Review):**

*   **Overview:** This paper is a preliminary scoping review analyzing 76 papers published between 2022 and early 2024 on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and video games. It categorizes the research into game AI, game development, narrative, and game research & reviews.
*   **Serious Games & Game-Based Learning:** The review highlights that LLMs are being used to support educators in developing serious games, aiding in brainstorming, game selection, personalization, alignment with curriculum, and providing feedback. It also notes that LLMs are used for role-playing game, board game, level and game generation in the context of serious games. The goal is often to assist time-constrained educators in creating educational games without needing extensive game development expertise. Researchers found that LLMs enhance the creation of serious games rather than replacing human designers. They emphasize that they can act as effective tools for diverse populations, including students, teachers and domain experts
*    **Game Design:** The review also describes how LLMs are being used for more general game design aspects like idea generation, and game mechanics design, such as synthesizing game elements based on chemical and physical properties.
*   **Narrative, Story, and Dialogue:**  A significant portion of the reviewed papers explores the use of LLMs for dialogue generation (mostly for NPCs), story generation, and quest generation. Research included exploration of in-context and style dialogue, and quest descriptions. While there are positive results in terms of enhanced player experience or human evaluations, researchers have identified challenges with NPC dialogue generation,  potential biases in the story generated, inconsistencies, incoherence and the transparency of AI-driven content.
*   **Game Research and Reviews:** The review indicates that LLMs are also being utilized for analyzing game reviews, player interviews, and generating synthetic data. LLMs were found to deal with the complex game vocabulary well, and with improvements on performance and reduced costs, but also suffer from variation in quality, lack of content depth, and can potentially cause data from crowd-sourced participants to become unreliable.
*   **Additional LLM4Rec papers:** The paper mentioned 9 additional papers using game datasets as part of broader LLM for recommendation research. They didn't fit the main focus but were included due to their relevance. The focus was on ranking-based recommendation, sequential recommendation, and interpretation.
*   **Conclusions:** The paper concludes that the research on LLMs in games is rapidly evolving, showing promise in many areas. There are identified positive effects like human interpretability, social behaviors, and the empowerment of non-developers but also noted some negative results such as lack of logical reasoning and unpredictability. This review is meant to be a snapshot of the current state to help lay the foundation for future research.
