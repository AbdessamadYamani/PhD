**Relevance to the Subject:**
This paper is highly relevant to the SLR on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT, in Serious Games. It provides a broad overview of how GPT is being used in various aspects of game development and gameplay, offering valuable insights into the current state of research and future trends. The paper's exploration of applications like mixed-initiative gameplay and user feedback mechanisms directly connects to the themes in serious games.

**Key Points from the Paper [GPT for Games] (Scoping Review):**

*   **Introduction:** The paper emphasizes the growing importance of LLMs, particularly GPT models, in games due to their natural language processing and generative capabilities. It notes that GPT is widely used due to its early release and superior performance and addresses a gap in prior reviews, aiming to provide the most recent overview with its updated methodology.
*   **Methodology:** A systematic search methodology was used across key computer science and AI databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Springer, AAAI) using "game" and "GPT" keywords. This method collected 131 papers, which were then classified through open coding.
*  **Categorization**: The papers were assigned into five categories:
    1.  **Procedural Content Generation (PCG):**  GPT is used to generate game assets, levels, and mechanics. Recent work includes generating 3D scenes with more complex geometry, game mechanics, and integrating programming assistance. One interesting finding is the ability of GPT to generate reward functions for DRL based on game descriptions.
    2.  **Mixed-Initiative Game Design:**  GPT assists game designers with idea generation, programming, and design frameworks. It was found that GPT can assist novice developers with coding but may not provide accurate advice on complex VR tasks. It also touches on areas such as detecting glitches in video games through multimodal LLMs, and generating dialog data for smaller models by fine-tuning.
    3.  **Mixed-Initiative Gameplay:** This focuses on GPT as an aid during play for story co-creation, feedback, and support for game masters, and has seen a significant increase in 2024. Co-creation involves alternating contributions between players and GPT. Feedback is more prevalent, especially in educational games, where personalized responses enhance player engagement. The use of GPT as a game master in TTRPGs has also been explored.
    4.  **GPT as a Game Player:** Here the paper explores GPT as an autonomous player or opponent in text-based (focusing on logical reasoning and social cognition) and non-text-based games. GPT can learn from users, make decisions, and generate strategic moves, and even play complex games with user instructions.
    5.  **GPT for Game User Research:** Includes the use of GPT for processing game reviews, analyzing player behavior, and other game user research methods. It was noted that user-generated content quality may be higher using AI-generated responses and that GPT can help by analyzing the game for toxic messages. Also noted was GPT's limitation in fully capturing emotional intensity and nuanced player strategies.

*   **Future Directions:** The paper suggests that future studies should focus on expanding the technical capabilities of GPT models, exploring the complex interaction dynamics between them and users, and also combine GPT with other technologies or frameworks to generate more complete game mechanics.
