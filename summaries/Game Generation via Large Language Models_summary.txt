**Relevance to the subject:** This paper is highly relevant to the topic of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into serious games, particularly in the realm of procedural content generation (PCG). It explores using LLMs not just for generating game levels but for simultaneously generating game rules and levels, which is a significant step towards more autonomous and flexible game design.

**Key Points:**

*   **Type:** Conference Paper
*   The paper introduces an LLM-based framework called "LLMGG" for generating both game rules and levels using Video Game Description Language (VGDL).
*   The framework takes text-based prompts, which can specify game names and context, including VGDL grammar, to generate corresponding VGDL rules and levels.
*   Experiments were conducted using different prompts and different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemma 7B) to validate the framework.  Different context combinations within the prompts were tested to see their impact on generation capabilities.
*   The prompts had different combinations of context, including basic game instruction, level mapping, grammar explanations, and examples of VGDL code.
*   The study established three validation criteria for generated VGDL code: Parsable, Logical, and Mappable, to check its quality.
*   The results show that only prompts with detailed context generate playable games, highlighting the importance of providing sufficient information about VGDL and game mechanics. GPT-4 showed greater accuracy and consistent results when compared to GPT-3.5 and Gemma 7B.  
*   LLMs are prone to "hallucination" leading to logically incorrect interactions (e.g. avatar is removed instead of the goal).  
*   It was found that LLMs struggle to self-correct even when provided with error corrections to their generated content.
*   The paper discusses that LLMs seem to interpret syntax of the interactions based on their understanding of natural language word order, thus the authors had more success by aligning the syntax of VGDL interactions to this natural language order to correct the errors.
*  The paper suggests that the LLMGG Framework is a viable approach for human, especially non-experts to design their own game prototypes via LLMs.
