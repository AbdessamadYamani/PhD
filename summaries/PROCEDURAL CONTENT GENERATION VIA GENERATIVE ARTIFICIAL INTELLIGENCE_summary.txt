**Relevance to the Subject:** This paper is highly relevant to the SLR on the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Serious Games, as it explores the broader use of generative AI, including foundational models that inform and enable current LLM development, in procedural content generation (PCG). Understanding how generative AI is currently applied in game development provides a vital backdrop for understanding the potential applications and challenges of integrating LLMs specifically. It delves into techniques used in the fields like GANs, Diffusion models, and Transformers, which are very relevant for a deeper understanding of the current state of the field, and how LLMs might impact the future.

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**

*   **Introduction to PCG:** The paper introduces PCG as a technology that uses algorithm-based methods to generate game content dynamically. It highlights PCG's role in reducing development costs, especially for small teams and large open-world games. The initial methods used basic randomization, but PCG has advanced significantly.
*   **Generative AI in PCG:** The authors review the applications of generative AI in PCG, focusing on the use of generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), Diffusion Models, and Transformers to create various content types (terrains, items, storylines). They underscore the rise of generative AI since the mid-2010s, emphasizing its potential in diverse game content generation, from environments to narratives.
*   **Challenges of Generative AI:** The paper identifies a key issue: the need for vast amounts of training data, which is often scarce due to the highly customized nature of game content. This poses a challenge for the straightforward implementation of many generative AI models. It stresses the need to overcome these limitations related to data scarcity.
*   **Content Validation:** It discusses the difficulty in validating PCG content, highlighting that content generated may have aesthetic or functional flaws. It talks about the use of metrics and game-playing agents as two methods, while they have their limitations (the first lacks details and the second is computationally expensive).
*  **Computational Cost:** the computational cost of generative AI itself is addressed as a significant challenge. The authors discuss how generative AI is computationally expensive, which can hinder the user experience. The paper also mentions the challenge of using AI in real-time and having a consistent performance across various devices.
*  **Current Approaches:** The paper identifies a clear trend in the use of techniques over time. Initially, GANs were popular, but later Diffusion Models and Transformers gained popularity for their superior performance. The paper also mentions the common trend of combining algorithms and techniques to produce better results.
*  **Generative AI vs. Reinforcement Learning:** The authors highlight the difference between the two in the context of PCG, where generative AI is suitable when there is abundant learnable data, while reinforcement learning may be more appropriate with scarce training data.
*   **Generative AI as Game Mechanics:** The authors explore the potential for using generative AI not just for development but as a game mechanic itself. It discusses the potential for narrative creation with NPCs using language models and for enhanced UGC editors which can offer stylized assets based on the needs of the user.
*   **Future Developments:** The paper anticipates future developments focusing on ease of use and higher quality, using combinations of different technologies and different approaches. It mentions data augmentation as an interesting way to overcome limitations of the training data, and also the use of text-based inputs and feedback mechanisms to facilitate the usage of such tools.
*   **Conclusion**: The paper concludes by emphasizing the diverse methods provided by generative AI for PCG with an analysis of its potential and current gaps, and suggesting future research to be done for its improvement.

**Paper Type**: This paper is a survey paper, and it is also a research paper as it introduces some research areas.
