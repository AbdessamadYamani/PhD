**Relevance to the Subject:** This technical report provides a thorough overview of the emerging field of "knowledge-integrated informed AI," which explores how incorporating explicit scientific or domain knowledge can enhance AI performance. This is highly relevant to the subject of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into Serious Games because LLMs could benefit from knowledge integration to address limitations of data-driven techniques, and the Serious Games can utilize the knowledge integrated AI for better performances. The discussion of knowledge representation, architectures for integration, and specific application examples is directly applicable to the development of more robust, reliable, and effective AI for complex, real-world problems that could be part of serious games. It is a paper of type **Technical Report**.

**Key Points from the Paper:**

*   The report identifies three categories of AI techniques based on their reliance on data and knowledge: (1) data-driven, (2) knowledge-based, and (3) "informed AI" that leverages both. The paper defines "knowledge-integrated informed AI" as techniques that explicitly integrate scientific, domain-specific, or data-centric knowledge into a modelâ€™s development pipeline. This explicit integration is the main distinguishing factor from standard methods.
*   The authors discuss how knowledge from various sources can be incorporated into AI, through different pathways (training data, hypothesis set, learning algorithm, and final hypothesis), and through different representations (algebraic equations, dynamical systems, logic rules, etc). They present various examples of how these representations and integration pathways may be achieved.
*   The paper reviews a number of examples of  "knowledge-integrated informed AI" approaches, spanning both deep learning and reinforcement learning, across several knowledge representations and integration pathways. These approaches have been shown to improve performance metrics, such as accuracy, explainability, generalizability, data efficiency, computational speedup, and reduction of network size.
*   It highlights that informed AI is important for the national security domain, where purely data-driven AI can have limitations. It emphasizes that "knowledge" is an important building block of AI technology.
*  The paper mentions different forms of knowledge integration such as, a) additional knowledge-containing dataset(s) where a data set is augmented with additional separate dataset, b) knowledge-based architecture or weights (a.k.a., hypothesis set) where knowledge is integrated into the initial architecture and/or weights of a neural network, c) knowledge-integrated learning algorithm where an additional term to the loss function of a network is added and d) learned-model consistency check (a.k.a., final hypothesis) where the final learned model can be re-defined.
*   The report also delves into the use of embedded and jointly trained neural networks, particularly neural network surrogates and those with surrounding mathematical structures, such as "universal differential equations", and "consequence modeling" where the final loss function is formulated from the application domain itself.
*   It identifies a need for exploring the tradespace across different knowledge integration techniques, theoretical and empirical research across techniques for select problems or problem classes.
*   The authors discuss a "programming language problem" wherein the current Python-based ecosystem for machine learning is not well-suited for all of the needs of knowledge-integrated informed AI and how the use of Julia as an alternative can foster further advancements.
*   It suggests a roadmap for accelerating research and development, focusing on data and knowledge-oriented steps as well as steps for promoting the adoption of these approaches into the national security domain.
