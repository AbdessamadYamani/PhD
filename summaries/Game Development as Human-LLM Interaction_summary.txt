This paper is highly relevant to the subject of exploring the impact of large language models (LLMs) on serious games, specifically in the area of game development. This study presents a new paradigm for game development, called Interaction-driven Game Engine (IGE), where users can develop custom games using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. The authors' work directly contributes to the knowledge of LLM's capability in aiding the creation of interactive experiences, which is foundational for many serious games. It's a "research" type paper based on the paper content (experimental evaluation)

**Key Points (as written in the paper):**

*   **Introduction of the Interaction-driven Game Engine (IGE):** The paper introduces IGE, a framework powered by LLMs that allows users to develop custom games using natural language through human-LLM interaction. This eliminates the steep learning curve associated with traditional game engines. The system is designed to receive natural language inputs, interpret them as calls to software interfaces, and generate corresponding implementation code.
*   **IGE's Multi-Turn Process:** The IGE functions through a multi-turn process where the LLM performs three steps in each turn: (1) `Pscript`: configures game script segments based on user input, (2) `Pcode`: generates corresponding code snippets, and (3) `Putter`: interacts with the user, providing guidance and feedback. This approach is designed for users with and without prior experience in coding.
*   **Data Synthesis Pipeline:** To overcome the challenge of obtaining large amounts of training data, the authors propose a data synthesis pipeline based on an LLM. This pipeline generates game script-code pairs and interactions automatically from a few manually crafted seed data.
*   **Three-Stage Progressive Training Strategy:**  To train the LLM effectively, the paper proposes a three-stage progressive training strategy which includes: Stage 1 focusing on base interaction ability, Stage 2 training the joint programming and interaction capability by using the interaction snippets, and Stage 3 aligning the model with complete interaction contexts as an IGE by using complete interactions.
*  **Poker Game Case Study:** The paper showcases a case study using the IGE with a poker game, utilizing the proposed data synthesis pipeline to generate a dataset. The performance is then evaluated from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper uses comprehensive evaluation metrics for both interaction quality (guidance, logic, relevance, coherence, conciseness) and code correctness (Functional Execution Success Rate(F-ESR), Functional Accuracy(F-Acc), Execution Success Rate(ESR), and Accuracy(Acc)). These metrics are designed to quantify the effectiveness of the IGE system.
*   **Experiment Results:** The experiments using a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model in a poker game case showed the effectiveness of the proposed IGE framework with better performance in both interaction quality and code correctness metrics compared to baseline models ( GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o). Also the ablation study confirmed the importance of every component of the framework and the training method.
*  **Ablation studies:** Show the importance of all the components including the `Pscript` process, synthetic data, and three-stage training method.
