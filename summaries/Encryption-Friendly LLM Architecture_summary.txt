**Relevance to the subject:**

This paper titled "Encryption-Friendly LLM Architecture," (Rho et al., 2024), is relevant to the exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and serious games because it addresses the critical issue of privacy concerns when using LLMs, a concern that has become more crucial when using the technology in a personal or sensitive context. While the paper is not directly focused on serious games, it introduces techniques to enable privacy-preserving operation of LLMs through homomorphic encryption, a technique that is relevant to any application of LLM when private information is involved. This technology could be leveraged in serious games to ensure user privacy in systems that would require personal data collection and analysis.

**Key Points from the paper:**

The authors propose a modified transformer architecture tailored for Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to enable privacy-preserving LLM inference, including fine-tuning.
-  They highlight the conflict between LLMâ€™s ability to provide personalized responses and user privacy concerns and suggest that HE can provide a solution for this by allowing computation on encrypted data.
- The paper focuses on two main challenges in applying HE to LLMs: the computational intensity of transformer models, which relies on numerous matrix multiplications and non-polynomial operations and the difficulty of achieving homomorphic encryption while maintaining accuracy.
- They tackle these challenges by: 
    - Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning to reduce the size of ciphertext-ciphertext matrix multiplications (CCMMs).
    - Replacing the softmax function in the attention mechanism with a Gaussian Kernel (GK), which is simpler to evaluate with HE.
- They achieve computational speedups of 6.94x for fine-tuning and 2.3x for inference compared to a naive homomorphic implementation while maintaining performance comparable to plaintext models. This is done by converting large CCMMs to large PCMMs and reducing the computational cost, which has been confirmed in various experimental result tables.
- The server-client computational model is defined where the client outsources fine-tuning and inference to an LLM service provider, with all user data being encrypted to ensure privacy even from the service provider.
- The paper describes the challenges of using HE for non-polynomial functions such as softmax, inverse square root and the approaches for optimizing them such as polynomial approximations.
- Experimental results using a modified BERT model on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate the practical application of the method, confirming that the proposed method achieves the same performance of the plain text implementation, as specified in the experimental section, while using homomorphic encryption.
- It notes that previous works on homomorphically encrypted transformers often overlooked fine-tuning due to complexity. The new contribution address both inference and fine-tuning challenges in privacy-preserving LLMs.
