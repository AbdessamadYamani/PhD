This paper, a **workshop paper**, is highly relevant to the SLR on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Serious Games, specifically because it delves into the crucial technological challenges associated with deploying ambient serious games, which will be relevant even with the use of LLMs in the creation of the mentioned games. The paper's identification of core technical barriers will inform our understanding of the infrastructure required to support more sophisticated games that include LLMs.

**Key points from the paper, as written:**

The paper [Technological Challenges of Ambient Serious Games in Higher Education] explores the potential of Ambient Serious Games in higher education, defining them as games embedded in a computer-enriched environment, only partially perceived mentally by the players. The authors present a scenario involving a lecturer using smart cubes and a tablet in a lecture to teach sorting algorithms, highlighting the potential benefits of such games. They identify five key technological challenges that need to be addressed to successfully integrate these games into teaching:

1.  **Integration of physical smart learning objects in heterogeneous environments under dynamic constraints:** The challenge here is that classrooms are not typically equipped for such games and are not adaptable enough to allow for a dynamic change of settings and objects based on different game needs. Games may require additional tangible objects, and the environment may have dynamically changing components (e.g., devices being brought in or removed during a session).

2.  **Representation of abstract subject matter using smart learning objects:** Many educational topics are abstract and not easily represented by tangible objects. The authors note that at least some smart learning objects need to be able to represent such abstract concepts.

3. **Guided or automatic connection of all involved components:** Setting up games should be easy and require as little effort as possible. The system should automatically discover and connect all involved components, including the game itself, but with some decision-making authority given to lecturers.

4.  **Explanation of the components, their interaction, as well as the serious game itself:** Both students and lecturers should be guided on how to play the game, with explanations of the devices' functions and interactions. The platform should provide instructions using various modalities.

5. **Feedback on the game state:** Feedback should be provided continuously and multimodally to both players and lecturers, indicating progress and correct/incorrect decisions. The system needs to locate devices and their positions to provide contextual feedback.

The authors [Technological Challenges of Ambient Serious Games in Higher Education] conclude that these challenges need to be addressed for successful integration. They discuss that while these technological challenges are critical, the integration of teaching content into the game design should also be a carefully planned effort. The authors further suggest that the software platform for Ambient Serious Games could take over the role of introduction and debriefing in the future. They plan to conduct further research on the integration, design, acceptance, and effectiveness of these games. They also want to study the broad use of the design concept of Ambient Serious Games and smart learning spaces.
