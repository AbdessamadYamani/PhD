This paper is a **preprint**, focusing on evaluating the multi-agent coordination abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of pure coordination games. It's directly relevant to the subject of exploring the integration of LLMs in serious games as it investigates how well LLMs can cooperate and coordinate with other agents, which is a crucial aspect of many serious games and simulations.

**Key Points:**

*   **LLM-Coordination Benchmark:** The authors introduce a new benchmark to analyze LLM coordination, consisting of two tasks:
    *   **Agentic Coordination:**  LLMs act as proactive participants in four pure coordination games: Hanabi, Overcooked-AI, Collab Capture, and Collab Escape.
    *   **Coordination Question Answering (QA):** LLMs answer multiple-choice questions from edge-case scenarios in the same games to evaluate environment comprehension, Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, and joint planning.
*   **Cognitive Architecture for Coordination (CAC):**  A plug-and-play framework is presented to integrate different LLMs into pure coordination games, comprised of Memory, Reasoning, and Grounding modules.
*   **Findings on Agentic Coordination:**
    *   LLM agents, especially those using GPT-4-turbo, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods in games that require environment awareness and commonsense actions, like Overcooked-AI.
    *   Unlike RL methods, LLM agents demonstrate robustness to new, unseen partners in "zero-shot" coordination.
    *   LLM agents struggle in complex games requiring advanced Theory of Mind reasoning such as Hanabi.
*   **Findings on Coordination QA:**
    *   LLMs perform well in environment comprehension but show significant limitations in ToM reasoning and joint planning. This highlights that while LLMs can understand game rules and states, they struggle with inferring othersâ€™ intentions and effectively planning for joint actions.
    *  There is moderate to strong correlation between Theory of Mind Reasoning, Environment Comprehension, and Joint Planning performance.
*   **CAC framework Enhancements:** The authors show that adding an auxiliary Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning module, and a Self-Verification Module improves the capabilities of LLMs in the Hanabi game.

**Citation:**

This paper [LLM-Coordination Evaluating and Analyzing Multi-agent Coordination Abilities in Large Language Models] explores the use of LLMs in pure coordination games. The authors develop the LLM-Coordination Benchmark (a suite of tasks which includes both agentic and QA evaluations of these models) and the Cognitive Architecture for Coordination framework, which enables LLMs to act effectively in multi-agent settings. Their findings reveal the potential, but also limitations, of current LLMs as cooperative agents. They further emphasize the importance of Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning and environment comprehension for effective joint planning, which aligns with the study of multi-agent interactions and teamwork in real-world scenarios which can be transferred in serious games.
